<span id="2.1.13">In those freckles live their savours:</span><br />

<span id="2.1.21">Because that she as her attendant hath</span><br />
<span id="2.1.22">A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;</span><br />
<span id="2.1.23">She never had so sweet a changeling;</span><br />

wild;</span><br />
<span id="2.1.26">But she perforce withholds the loved boy,</span><br />

joy:</span><br />

sheen,</span><br />

laugh,</span><br />

<span id="2.1.86">Or in the beached margent of the sea,</span><br />

wind,</span><br />
<span id="2.1.88">But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our
sport.</span><br />
<span id="2.1.89">Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,</span><br />

which:</span><br />

<blockquote>
<p><span id="1.2.96">I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.97">As well as I do know your outward favour.</span><br />
<span id="1.2.98">Well, honour is the subject of my story.</span><br />
<span id="1.2.99">I cannot tell what you and other men</span><br />
<span id="1.2.100">Think of this life; but, for my single
self,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.101">I had as lief not be as live to be</span><br />
<span id="1.2.102">In awe of such a thing as I myself.</span><br />
<span id="1.2.103">I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</span><br />
<span id="1.2.104">We both have fed as well, and we can both</span><br />
<span id="1.2.105">Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</span><br />
<span id="1.2.106">For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.107">The troubled Tiber chafing with her
shores,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.108">Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius,
now</span><br />
<span id="1.2.109">Leap in with me into this angry flood,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.110">And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.111">Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</span><br />
<span id="1.2.112">And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</span><br />
<span id="1.2.113">The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</span><br />
<span id="1.2.114">With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</span><br />
<span id="1.2.115">And stemming it with hearts of
controversy;</span><br />
<span id="1.2.116">But ere we could arrive the point
proposed,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.117">Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I
sink!'</span><br />
<span id="1.2.118">I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.119">Did from the flames of Troy upon his
shoulder</span><br />
<span id="1.2.120">The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of
Tiber</span><br />
<span id="1.2.121">Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</span><br />
<span id="1.2.122">Is now become a god, and Cassius is</span><br />
<span id="1.2.123">A wretched creature and must bend his
body,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.124">If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</span><br />
<span id="1.2.125">He had a fever when he was in Spain,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.126">And when the fit was on him, I did mark</span><br />
<span id="1.2.127">How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did
shake;</span><br />
<span id="1.2.128">His coward lips did from their colour fly,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.129">And that same eye whose bend doth awe the
world</span><br />
<span id="1.2.130">Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</span><br />
<span id="1.2.131">Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the
Romans</span><br />
<span id="1.2.132">Mark him and write his speeches in their
books,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.133">Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink,
Titinius,'</span><br />
<span id="1.2.134">As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</span><br />
<span id="1.2.135">A man of such a feeble temper should</span><br />
<span id="1.2.136">So get the start of the majestic world</span><br />
<span id="1.2.137">And bear the palm alone.</span></p>
<p><em>Shout. Flourish</em></p>

Caesar.</span></p>

<p><span id="1.2.141">Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow
world</span><br />

<span id="1.2.143">Walk under his huge legs and peep about</span><br />
<span id="1.2.144">To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</span><br />
<span id="1.2.145">Men at some time are masters of their
fates:</span><br />
<span id="1.2.146">The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our
stars,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.147">But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</span><br />
<span id="1.2.148">Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that
'Caesar'?</span><br />
<span id="1.2.149">Why should that name be sounded more than
yours?</span><br />
<span id="1.2.150">Write them together, yours is as fair a
name;</span><br />
<span id="1.2.151">Sound them, it doth become the mouth as
well;</span><br />
<span id="1.2.152">Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with
'em,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.153">Brutus will start a spirit as soon as
Caesar.</span><br />
<span id="1.2.154">Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</span><br />

<span id="1.2.156">That he is grown so great? Age, thou art
shamed!</span><br />
<span id="1.2.157">Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble
bloods!</span><br />
<span id="1.2.158">When went there by an age, since the great
flood,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.159">But it was famed with more than with one
man?</span><br />
<span id="1.2.160">When could they say till now, that talk'd of
Rome,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.161">That her wide walls encompass'd but one
man?</span><br />
<span id="1.2.162">Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.163">When there is in it but one only man.</span><br />
<span id="1.2.164">O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</span><br />
<span id="1.2.165">There was a Brutus once that would have
brook'd</span><br />
<span id="1.2.166">The eternal devil to keep his state in
Rome</span><br />

present,</span><br />

<span id="1.2.176">Both meet to hear and answer such high
things.</span><br />
<span id="1.2.177">Till then, my noble friend, chew upon
this:</span><br />
<span id="1.2.178">Brutus had rather be a villager</span><br />
<span id="1.2.179">Than to repute himself a son of Rome</span><br />
<span id="1.2.180">Under these hard conditions as this time</span><br />

much;</span><br />

again:</span><br />
