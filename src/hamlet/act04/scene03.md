## SCENE III

### Another room in the castle.

> *Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended*

<span id="speech1">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.1">I have sent to seek him, and to find the
> body.</span>  
> <span id="4.3.2">How dangerous is it that this man goes
> loose!</span>  
> <span id="4.3.3">Yet must not we put the strong law on him:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.4">He's loved of the distracted multitude,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.5">Who like not in their judgment, but their
> eyes;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.6">And where tis so, the offender's scourge is
> weigh'd,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.7">But never the offence. To bear all smooth and
> even,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.8">This sudden sending him away must seem</span>  
> <span id="4.3.9">Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown</span>  
> <span id="4.3.10">By desperate appliance are relieved,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.11">Or not at all.</span>  
>
> *Enter ROSENCRANTZ*
>
> <span id="4.3.12">How now! what hath befall'n?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="4.3.13">Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.14">We cannot get from him.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.15">But where is he?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="4.3.16">Without, my lord; guarded, to know your
> pleasure.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.17">Bring him before us.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="4.3.18">Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.</span>  
>
> *Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN*

<span id="speech7">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.19">Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.3.20">At supper.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.21">At supper! where?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.3.22">Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a
> certain</span>  
> <span id="4.3.23">convocation of politic worms are e'en at him.
> Your</span>  
> <span id="4.3.24">worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat
> all</span>  
> <span id="4.3.25">creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves
> for</span>  
> <span id="4.3.26">maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is
> but</span>  
> <span id="4.3.27">variable service, two dishes, but to one
> table:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.28">that's the end.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.29">Alas, alas!</span>  

<span id="speech12">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.3.30">A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of
> a</span>  
> <span id="4.3.31">king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that
> worm.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.32">What dost you mean by this?</span>  

<span id="speech14">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.3.33">Nothing but to show you how a king may go a</span>  
> <span id="4.3.34">progress through the guts of a beggar.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.35">Where is Polonius?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.3.36">In heaven; send hither to see: if your
> messenger</span>  
> <span id="4.3.37">find him not there, seek him i' the other
> place</span>  
> <span id="4.3.38">yourself. But indeed, if you find him not
> within</span>  
> <span id="4.3.39">this month, you shall nose him as you go up
> the</span>  
> <span id="4.3.40">stairs into the lobby.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.41">Go seek him there.</span>  
>
> *To some Attendants*

<span id="speech18">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.3.42">He will stay till ye come.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt Attendants*

<span id="speech19">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.43">Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial
> safety,--</span>  
> <span id="4.3.44">Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve</span>  
> <span id="4.3.45">For that which thou hast done,--must send thee
> hence</span>  
> <span id="4.3.46">With fiery quickness: therefore prepare
> thyself;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.47">The bark is ready, and the wind at help,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.48">The associates tend, and every thing is
> bent</span>  
> <span id="4.3.49">For England.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.3.50">For England!</span>  

<span id="speech21">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.51">Ay, Hamlet.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.3.52">Good.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.53">So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.3.54">I see a cherub that sees them. But, come;
> for</span>  
> <span id="4.3.55">England! Farewell, dear mother.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.56">Thy loving father, Hamlet.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.3.57">My mother: father and mother is man and wife;
> man</span>  
> <span id="4.3.58">and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for
> England!</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech27">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.59">Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed
> aboard;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.60">Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.61">Away! for every thing is seal'd and done</span>  
> <span id="4.3.62">That else leans on the affair: pray you, make
> haste.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN*
>
> <span id="4.3.63">And, England, if my love thou hold'st at
> aught--</span>  
> <span id="4.3.64">As my great power thereof may give thee
> sense,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.65">Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red</span>  
> <span id="4.3.66">After the Danish sword, and thy free awe</span>  
> <span id="4.3.67">Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly
> set</span>  
> <span id="4.3.68">Our sovereign process; which imports at
> full,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.69">By letters congruing to that effect,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.70">The present death of Hamlet. Do it,
> England;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.71">For like the hectic in my blood he rages,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.72">And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis
> done,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.73">Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.</span>  
>
> *Exit*
