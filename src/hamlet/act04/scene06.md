<span id="speech1">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="4.6.1">What are they that would speak with me?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="4.6.2">Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for
> you.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="4.6.3">Let them come in.</span>  
>
> *Exit Servant*
>
> <span id="4.6.4">I do not know from what part of the world</span>  
> <span id="4.6.5">I should be greeted, if not from Lord
> Hamlet.</span>  
>
> *Enter Sailors*

<span id="speech4">**First Sailor**</span>

> <span id="4.6.6">God bless you, sir.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="4.6.7">Let him bless thee too.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**First Sailor**</span>

> <span id="4.6.8">He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter
> for</span>  
> <span id="4.6.9">you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that
> was</span>  
> <span id="4.6.10">bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I
> am</span>  
> <span id="4.6.11">let to know it is.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="4.6.12">\[Reads\] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have
> overlooked</span>  
> <span id="4.6.13">this, give these fellows some means to the
> king:</span>  
> <span id="4.6.14">they have letters for him. Ere we were two days
> old</span>  
> <span id="4.6.15">at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave
> us</span>  
> <span id="4.6.16">chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put
> on</span>  
> <span id="4.6.17">a compelled valour, and in the grapple I
> boarded</span>  
> <span id="4.6.18">them: on the instant they got clear of our ship;
> so</span>  
> <span id="4.6.19">I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt
> with</span>  
> <span id="4.6.20">me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what
> they</span>  
> <span id="4.6.21">did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the
> king</span>  
> <span id="4.6.22">have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to
> me</span>  
> <span id="4.6.23">with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death.
> I</span>  
> <span id="4.6.24">have words to speak in thine ear will make
> thee</span>  
> <span id="4.6.25">dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore
> of</span>  
> <span id="4.6.26">the matter. These good fellows will bring
> thee</span>  
> <span id="4.6.27">where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold
> their</span>  
> <span id="4.6.28">course for England: of them I have much to
> tell</span>  
> <span id="4.6.29">thee. Farewell.</span>  
> <span id="4.6.30">'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'</span>  
> <span id="4.6.31">Come, I will make you way for these your
> letters;</span>  
> <span id="4.6.32">And do't the speedier, that you may direct
> me</span>  
> <span id="4.6.33">To him from whom you brought them.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
