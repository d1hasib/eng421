## SCENE IV

### A plain in Denmark.

> *Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching*

<span id="speech1">**PRINCE FORTINBRAS**</span>

> <span id="4.4.1">Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;</span>  
> <span id="4.4.2">Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras</span>  
> <span id="4.4.3">Craves the conveyance of a promised march</span>  
> <span id="4.4.4">Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.</span>  
> <span id="4.4.5">If that his majesty would aught with us,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.6">We shall express our duty in his eye;</span>  
> <span id="4.4.7">And let him know so.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Captain**</span>

> <span id="4.4.8">I will do't, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**PRINCE FORTINBRAS**</span>

> <span id="4.4.9">Go softly on.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers*
>
> *Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others*

<span id="speech4">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.4.10">Good sir, whose powers are these?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**Captain**</span>

> <span id="4.4.11">They are of Norway, sir.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.4.12">How purposed, sir, I pray you?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**Captain**</span>

> <span id="4.4.13">Against some part of Poland.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.4.14">Who commands them, sir?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**Captain**</span>

> <span id="4.4.15">The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.4.16">Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.17">Or for some frontier?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**Captain**</span>

> <span id="4.4.18">Truly to speak, and with no addition,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.19">We go to gain a little patch of ground</span>  
> <span id="4.4.20">That hath in it no profit but the name.</span>  
> <span id="4.4.21">To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm
> it;</span>  
> <span id="4.4.22">Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole</span>  
> <span id="4.4.23">A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.4.24">Why, then the Polack never will defend it.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**Captain**</span>

> <span id="4.4.25">Yes, it is already garrison'd.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.4.26">Two thousand souls and twenty thousand
> ducats</span>  
> <span id="4.4.27">Will not debate the question of this straw:</span>  
> <span id="4.4.28">This is the imposthume of much wealth and
> peace,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.29">That inward breaks, and shows no cause
> without</span>  
> <span id="4.4.30">Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**Captain**</span>

> <span id="4.4.31">God be wi' you, sir.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech16">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="4.4.32">Wilt please you go, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech17">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.4.33">I'll be with you straight go a little
> before.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt all except HAMLET*
>
> <span id="4.4.34">How all occasions do inform against me,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.35">And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.36">If his chief good and market of his time</span>  
> <span id="4.4.37">Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.</span>  
> <span id="4.4.38">Sure, he that made us with such large
> discourse,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.39">Looking before and after, gave us not</span>  
> <span id="4.4.40">That capability and god-like reason</span>  
> <span id="4.4.41">To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be</span>  
> <span id="4.4.42">Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple</span>  
> <span id="4.4.43">Of thinking too precisely on the event,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.44">A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part
> wisdom</span>  
> <span id="4.4.45">And ever three parts coward, I do not know</span>  
> <span id="4.4.46">Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'</span>  
> <span id="4.4.47">Sith I have cause and will and strength and
> means</span>  
> <span id="4.4.48">To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:</span>  
> <span id="4.4.49">Witness this army of such mass and charge</span>  
> <span id="4.4.50">Led by a delicate and tender prince,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.51">Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd</span>  
> <span id="4.4.52">Makes mouths at the invisible event,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.53">Exposing what is mortal and unsure</span>  
> <span id="4.4.54">To all that fortune, death and danger dare,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.55">Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great</span>  
> <span id="4.4.56">Is not to stir without great argument,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.57">But greatly to find quarrel in a straw</span>  
> <span id="4.4.58">When honour's at the stake. How stand I
> then,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.59">That have a father kill'd, a mother
> stain'd,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.60">Excitements of my reason and my blood,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.61">And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I
> see</span>  
> <span id="4.4.62">The imminent death of twenty thousand men,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.63">That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.64">Go to their graves like beds, fight for a
> plot</span>  
> <span id="4.4.65">Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.66">Which is not tomb enough and continent</span>  
> <span id="4.4.67">To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,</span>  
> <span id="4.4.68">My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!</span>  
>
> *Exit*
