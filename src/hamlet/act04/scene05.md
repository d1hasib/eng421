## SCENE V

### Elsinore. A room in the castle.

> *Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman*

<span id="speech1">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.5.1">I will not speak with her.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Gentleman**</span>

> <span id="4.5.2">She is importunate, indeed distract:</span>  
> <span id="4.5.3">Her mood will needs be pitied.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.5.4">What would she have?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Gentleman**</span>

> <span id="4.5.5">She speaks much of her father; says she
> hears</span>  
> <span id="4.5.6">There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her
> heart;</span>  
> <span id="4.5.7">Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in
> doubt,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.8">That carry but half sense: her speech is
> nothing,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.9">Yet the unshaped use of it doth move</span>  
> <span id="4.5.10">The hearers to collection; they aim at it,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.11">And botch the words up fit to their own
> thoughts;</span>  
> <span id="4.5.12">Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures</span>  
> <span id="4.5.13">yield them,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.14">Indeed would make one think there might be
> thought,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.15">Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="4.5.16">'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may
> strew</span>  
> <span id="4.5.17">Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding
> minds.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.5.18">Let her come in.</span>  
>
> *Exit HORATIO*
>
> <span id="4.5.19">To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.20">Each toy seems prologue to some great
> amiss:</span>  
> <span id="4.5.21">So full of artless jealousy is guilt,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.22">It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA*

<span id="speech7">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="4.5.23">Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.5.24">How now, Ophelia!</span>  

<span id="speech9">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="4.5.25">\[Sings\]</span>  
> <span id="4.5.26">How should I your true love know</span>  
> <span id="4.5.27">From another one?</span>  
> <span id="4.5.28">By his cockle hat and staff,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.29">And his sandal shoon.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.5.30">Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="4.5.31">Say you? nay, pray you, mark.</span>  
>
> *Sings*
>
> <span id="4.5.32">He is dead and gone, lady,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.33">He is dead and gone;</span>  
> <span id="4.5.34">At his head a grass-green turf,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.35">At his heels a stone.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.5.36">Nay, but, Ophelia,--</span>  

<span id="speech13">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="4.5.37">Pray you, mark.</span>  
>
> *Sings*
>
> <span id="4.5.38">White his shroud as the mountain snow,--</span>  
>
> *Enter KING CLAUDIUS*

<span id="speech14">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.5.39">Alas, look here, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="4.5.40">\[Sings\]</span>  
> <span id="4.5.41">Larded with sweet flowers</span>  
> <span id="4.5.42">Which bewept to the grave did go</span>  
> <span id="4.5.43">With true-love showers.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.44">How do you, pretty lady?</span>  

<span id="speech17">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="4.5.45">Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a
> baker's</span>  
> <span id="4.5.46">daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know
> not</span>  
> <span id="4.5.47">what we may be. God be at your table!</span>  

<span id="speech18">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.48">Conceit upon her father.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="4.5.49">Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when
> they</span>  
> <span id="4.5.50">ask you what it means, say you this:</span>  
>
> *Sings*
>
> <span id="4.5.51">To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.52">All in the morning betime,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.53">And I a maid at your window,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.54">To be your Valentine.</span>  
> <span id="4.5.55">Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.56">And dupp'd the chamber-door;</span>  
> <span id="4.5.57">Let in the maid, that out a maid</span>  
> <span id="4.5.58">Never departed more.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.59">Pretty Ophelia!</span>  

<span id="speech21">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="4.5.60">Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end
> on't:</span>  
>
> *Sings*
>
> <span id="4.5.61">By Gis and by Saint Charity,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.62">Alack, and fie for shame!</span>  
> <span id="4.5.63">Young men will do't, if they come to't;</span>  
> <span id="4.5.64">By cock, they are to blame.</span>  
> <span id="4.5.65">Quoth she, before you tumbled me,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.66">You promised me to wed.</span>  
> <span id="4.5.67">So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.68">An thou hadst not come to my bed.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.69">How long hath she been thus?</span>  

<span id="speech23">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="4.5.70">I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but
> I</span>  
> <span id="4.5.71">cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay
> him</span>  
> <span id="4.5.72">i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of
> it:</span>  
> <span id="4.5.73">and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come,
> my</span>  
> <span id="4.5.74">coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet
> ladies;</span>  
> <span id="4.5.75">good night, good night.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech24">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.76">Follow her close; give her good watch,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.77">I pray you.</span>  
>
> *Exit HORATIO*
>
> <span id="4.5.78">O, this is the poison of deep grief; it
> springs</span>  
> <span id="4.5.79">All from her father's death. O Gertrude,
> Gertrude,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.80">When sorrows come, they come not single
> spies</span>  
> <span id="4.5.81">But in battalions. First, her father slain:</span>  
> <span id="4.5.82">Next, your son gone; and he most violent
> author</span>  
> <span id="4.5.83">Of his own just remove: the people muddied,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.84">Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and
> whispers,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.85">For good Polonius' death; and we have done but
> greenly,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.86">In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia</span>  
> <span id="4.5.87">Divided from herself and her fair judgment,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.88">Without the which we are pictures, or mere
> beasts:</span>  
> <span id="4.5.89">Last, and as much containing as all these,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.90">Her brother is in secret come from France;</span>  
> <span id="4.5.91">Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in
> clouds,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.92">And wants not buzzers to infect his ear</span>  
> <span id="4.5.93">With pestilent speeches of his father's
> death;</span>  
> <span id="4.5.94">Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.95">Will nothing stick our person to arraign</span>  
> <span id="4.5.96">In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.97">Like to a murdering-piece, in many places</span>  
> <span id="4.5.98">Gives me superfluous death.</span>  
>
> *A noise within*

<span id="speech25">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.5.99">Alack, what noise is this?</span>  

<span id="speech26">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.100">Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the
> door.</span>  
>
> *Enter another Gentleman*
>
> <span id="4.5.101">What is the matter?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**Gentleman**</span>

> <span id="4.5.102">Save yourself, my lord:</span>  
> <span id="4.5.103">The ocean, overpeering of his list,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.104">Eats not the flats with more impetuous
> haste</span>  
> <span id="4.5.105">Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.106">O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him
> lord;</span>  
> <span id="4.5.107">And, as the world were now but to begin,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.108">Antiquity forgot, custom not known,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.109">The ratifiers and props of every word,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.110">They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be
> king:'</span>  
> <span id="4.5.111">Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the
> clouds:</span>  
> <span id="4.5.112">'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'</span>  

<span id="speech28">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.5.113">How cheerfully on the false trail they
> cry!</span>  
> <span id="4.5.114">O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!</span>  

<span id="speech29">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.115">The doors are broke.</span>  
>
> *Noise within*
>
> *Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following*

<span id="speech30">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.5.116">Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all
> without.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**Danes**</span>

> <span id="4.5.117">No, let's come in.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.5.118">I pray you, give me leave.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**Danes**</span>

> <span id="4.5.119">We will, we will.</span>  
>
> *They retire without the door*

<span id="speech34">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.5.120">I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile

> <span id="4.5.121">Give me my father!</span>  

<span id="speech35">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.5.122">Calmly, good Laertes.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.5.123">That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me

> <span id="4.5.124">Cries cuckold to my father, brands the

> <span id="4.5.125">Even here, between the chaste unsmirched

> <span id="4.5.126">Of my true mother.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.127">What is the cause, Laertes,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.128">That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?</span>  
> <span id="4.5.129">Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our

> <span id="4.5.130">There's such divinity doth hedge a king,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.131">That treason can but peep to what it
> would,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.132">Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.133">Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go,
> Gertrude.</span>  
> <span id="4.5.134">Speak, man.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.5.135">Where is my father?</span>  

<span id="speech39">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.136">Dead.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.5.137">But not by him.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.138">Let him demand his fill.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.5.139">How came he dead? I'll not be juggled

> <span id="4.5.140">To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest

> <span id="4.5.141">Conscience and grace, to the profoundest

> <span id="4.5.142">I dare damnation. To this point I stand,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.143">That both the worlds I give to negligence,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.144">Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged</span>  
> <span id="4.5.145">Most thoroughly for my father.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.146">Who shall stay you?</span>  

<span id="speech44">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.5.147">My will, not all the world:</span>  
> <span id="4.5.148">And for my means, I'll husband them so
> well,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.149">They shall go far with little.</span>  

<span id="speech45">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.150">Good Laertes,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.151">If you desire to know the certainty</span>  
> <span id="4.5.152">Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your
> revenge,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.153">That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and

> <span id="4.5.154">Winner and loser?</span>  

<span id="speech46">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.5.155">None but his enemies.</span>  

<span id="speech47">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.156">Will you know them then?</span>  

<span id="speech48">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.5.157">To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my
> arms;</span>  
> <span id="4.5.158">And like the kind life-rendering pelican,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.159">Repast them with my blood.</span>  

<span id="speech49">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.5.160">Why, now you speak</span>  
> <span id="4.5.161">Like a good child and a true gentleman.</span>  
> <span id="4.5.162">That I am guiltless of your father's
> death,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.163">And am most sensible in grief for it,</span>  
> <span id="4.5.164">It shall as level to your judgment pierce</span>

<span id="speech50">**Danes**</span>

> <span id="4.5.166">\[Within\] Let her come in.</span>  

<span id="speech51">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.5.167">How now! what noise is that?</span>  
>
> *Re-enter OPHELIA*
>
> <span id="4.5.168">O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times

> <span id="4.5.169">Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!</span>
