## SCENE VII

### Another room in the castle.

> *Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES*

<span id="speech1">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.1">Now must your conscience my acquaintance
> seal,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.2">And you must put me in your heart for
> friend,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.3">Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.4">That he which hath your noble father slain</span>  
> <span id="4.7.5">Pursued my life.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.6">It well appears: but tell me</span>  
> <span id="4.7.7">Why you proceeded not against these feats,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.8">So crimeful and so capital in nature,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.9">As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.10">You mainly were stirr'd up.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.11">O, for two special reasons;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.12">Which may to you, perhaps, seem much
> unsinew'd,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.13">But yet to me they are strong. The queen his
> mother</span>  
> <span id="4.7.14">Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--</span>  
> <span id="4.7.15">My virtue or my plague, be it either
> which--</span>  
> <span id="4.7.16">She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.17">That, as the star moves not but in his
> sphere,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.18">I could not but by her. The other motive,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.19">Why to a public count I might not go,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.20">Is the great love the general gender bear
> him;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.21">Who, dipping all his faults in their
> affection,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.22">Would, like the spring that turneth wood to
> stone,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.23">Convert his gyves to graces; so that my
> arrows,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.24">Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.25">Would have reverted to my bow again,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.26">And not where I had aim'd them.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.27">And so have I a noble father lost;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.28">A sister driven into desperate terms,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.29">Whose worth, if praises may go back again,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.30">Stood challenger on mount of all the age</span>  
> <span id="4.7.31">For her perfections: but my revenge will
> come.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.32">Break not your sleeps for that: you must not
> think</span>  
> <span id="4.7.33">That we are made of stuff so flat and dull</span>  
> <span id="4.7.34">That we can let our beard be shook with
> danger</span>  
> <span id="4.7.35">And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear
> more:</span>  
> <span id="4.7.36">I loved your father, and we love ourself;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.37">And that, I hope, will teach you to
> imagine--</span>  
>
> *Enter a Messenger*
>
> <span id="4.7.38">How now! what news?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Messenger**</span>

> <span id="4.7.39">Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:</span>  
> <span id="4.7.40">This to your majesty; this to the queen.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.41">From Hamlet! who brought them?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**Messenger**</span>

> <span id="4.7.42">Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:</span>  
> <span id="4.7.43">They were given me by Claudio; he received
> them</span>  
> <span id="4.7.44">Of him that brought them.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.45">Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.</span>  
>
> *Exit Messenger*
>
> *Reads*
>
> <span id="4.7.46">'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked
> on</span>  
> <span id="4.7.47">your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to
> see</span>  
> <span id="4.7.48">your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking
> your</span>  
> <span id="4.7.49">pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my
> sudden</span>  
> <span id="4.7.50">and more strange return. 'HAMLET.'</span>  
> <span id="4.7.51">What should this mean? Are all the rest come
> back?</span>  
> <span id="4.7.52">Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.53">Know you the hand?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.54">'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!</span>  
> <span id="4.7.55">And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'</span>  
> <span id="4.7.56">Can you advise me?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.57">I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.58">It warms the very sickness in my heart,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.59">That I shall live and tell him to his
> teeth,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.60">'Thus didest thou.'</span>  

<span id="speech13">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.61">If it be so, Laertes--</span>  
> <span id="4.7.62">As how should it be so? how otherwise?--</span>  
> <span id="4.7.63">Will you be ruled by me?</span>  

<span id="speech14">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.64">Ay, my lord;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.65">So you will not o'errule me to a peace.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.66">To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.67">As checking at his voyage, and that he
> means</span>  
> <span id="4.7.68">No more to undertake it, I will work him</span>  
> <span id="4.7.69">To an exploit, now ripe in my device,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.70">Under the which he shall not choose but
> fall:</span>  
> <span id="4.7.71">And for his death no wind of blame shall
> breathe,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.72">But even his mother shall uncharge the
> practise</span>  
> <span id="4.7.73">And call it accident.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.74">My lord, I will be ruled;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.75">The rather, if you could devise it so</span>  
> <span id="4.7.76">That I might be the organ.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.77">It falls right.</span>  
> <span id="4.7.78">You have been talk'd of since your travel
> much,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.79">And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality</span>  
> <span id="4.7.80">Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of
> parts</span>  
> <span id="4.7.81">Did not together pluck such envy from him</span>  
> <span id="4.7.82">As did that one, and that, in my regard,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.83">Of the unworthiest siege.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.84">What part is that, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech19">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.85">A very riband in the cap of youth,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.86">Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes</span>  
> <span id="4.7.87">The light and careless livery that it wears</span>  
> <span id="4.7.88">Than settled age his sables and his weeds,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.89">Importing health and graveness. Two months
> since,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.90">Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--</span>  
> <span id="4.7.91">I've seen myself, and served against, the
> French,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.92">And they can well on horseback: but this
> gallant</span>  
> <span id="4.7.93">Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.94">And to such wondrous doing brought his
> horse,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.95">As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured</span>  
> <span id="4.7.96">With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my
> thought,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.97">That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.98">Come short of what he did.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.99">A Norman was't?</span>  

<span id="speech21">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.100">A Norman.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.101">Upon my life, Lamond.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.102">The very same.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.103">I know him well: he is the brooch indeed</span>  
> <span id="4.7.104">And gem of all the nation.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.105">He made confession of you,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.106">And gave you such a masterly report</span>  
> <span id="4.7.107">For art and exercise in your defence</span>  
> <span id="4.7.108">And for your rapier most especially,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.109">That he cried out, 'twould be a sight
> indeed,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.110">If one could match you: the scrimers of their
> nation,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.111">He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor
> eye,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.112">If you opposed them. Sir, this report of
> his</span>  
> <span id="4.7.113">Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy</span>  
> <span id="4.7.114">That he could nothing do but wish and beg</span>  
> <span id="4.7.115">Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.</span>  
> <span id="4.7.116">Now, out of this,--</span>  

<span id="speech26">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.117">What out of this, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.118">Laertes, was your father dear to you?</span>  
> <span id="4.7.119">Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.120">A face without a heart?</span>  

<span id="speech28">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.121">Why ask you this?</span>  

<span id="speech29">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.122">Not that I think you did not love your
> father;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.123">But that I know love is begun by time;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.124">And that I see, in passages of proof,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.125">Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.</span>  
> <span id="4.7.126">There lives within the very flame of love</span>  
> <span id="4.7.127">A kind of wick or snuff that will abate
> it;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.128">And nothing is at a like goodness still;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.129">For goodness, growing to a plurisy,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.130">Dies in his own too much: that we would do</span>  
> <span id="4.7.131">We should do when we would; for this 'would'
> changes</span>  
> <span id="4.7.132">And hath abatements and delays as many</span>  
> <span id="4.7.133">As there are tongues, are hands, are
> accidents;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.134">And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift
> sigh,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.135">That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the
> ulcer:--</span>  
> <span id="4.7.136">Hamlet comes back: what would you
> undertake,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.137">To show yourself your father's son in deed</span>  
> <span id="4.7.138">More than in words?</span>  

<span id="speech30">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.139">To cut his throat i' the church.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.140">No place, indeed, should murder
> sanctuarize;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.141">Revenge should have no bounds. But, good
> Laertes,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.142">Will you do this, keep close within your
> chamber.</span>  
> <span id="4.7.143">Hamlet return'd shall know you are come
> home:</span>  
> <span id="4.7.144">We'll put on those shall praise your
> excellence</span>  
> <span id="4.7.145">And set a double varnish on the fame</span>  
> <span id="4.7.146">The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine
> together</span>  
> <span id="4.7.147">And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.148">Most generous and free from all
> contriving,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.149">Will not peruse the foils; so that, with
> ease,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.150">Or with a little shuffling, you may choose</span>  
> <span id="4.7.151">A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise</span>  
> <span id="4.7.152">Requite him for your father.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.153">I will do't:</span>  
> <span id="4.7.154">And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my
> sword.</span>  
> <span id="4.7.155">I bought an unction of a mountebank,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.156">So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.157">Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.158">Collected from all simples that have
> virtue</span>  
> <span id="4.7.159">Under the moon, can save the thing from
> death</span>  
> <span id="4.7.160">That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my
> point</span>  
> <span id="4.7.161">With this contagion, that, if I gall him
> slightly,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.162">It may be death.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.7.163">Let's further think of this;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.164">Weigh what convenience both of time and
> means</span>  
> <span id="4.7.165">May fit us to our shape: if this should
> fail,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.166">And that our drift look through our bad
> performance,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.167">'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this
> project</span>  
> <span id="4.7.168">Should have a back or second, that might
> hold,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.169">If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me
> see:</span>  
> <span id="4.7.170">We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I
> ha't.</span>  
> <span id="4.7.171">When in your motion you are hot and dry--</span>  
> <span id="4.7.172">As make your bouts more violent to that
> end--</span>  
> <span id="4.7.173">And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared
> him</span>  
> <span id="4.7.174">A chalice for the nonce, whereon but
> sipping,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.175">If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.176">Our purpose may hold there.</span>  
>
> *Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE*
>
> <span id="4.7.177">How now, sweet queen!</span>  

<span id="speech34">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.7.178">One woe doth tread upon another's heel,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.179">So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd,
> Laertes.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.180">Drown'd! O, where?</span>  

<span id="speech36">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.7.181">There is a willow grows aslant a brook,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.182">That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy
> stream;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.183">There with fantastic garlands did she come</span>  
> <span id="4.7.184">Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long
> purples</span>  
> <span id="4.7.185">That liberal shepherds give a grosser

> <span id="4.7.186">But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call

> <span id="4.7.187">There, on the pendent boughs her coronet
> weeds</span>  
> <span id="4.7.188">Clambering to hang, an envious sliver
> broke;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.189">When down her weedy trophies and herself</span>  
> <span id="4.7.190">Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread
> wide;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.191">And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her
> up:</span>  
> <span id="4.7.192">Which time she chanted snatches of old
> tunes;</span>  
> <span id="4.7.193">As one incapable of her own distress,</span>  
> <span id="4.7.194">Or like a creature native and indued</span>  
> <span id="4.7.195">Unto that element: but long it could not
> be</span>  
> <span id="4.7.196">Till that her garments, heavy with their

> <span id="4.7.197">Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious

> <span id="4.7.198">To muddy death.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.199">Alas, then, she is drown'd?</span>  

<span id="speech38">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.7.200">Drown'd, drown'd.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="4.7.201">Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,</span>
