### A room in the castle.

> *Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN*

<span id="speech1">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.1">There's matter in these sighs, these profound
> heaves:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.2">You must translate: 'tis fit we understand
> them.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.3">Where is your son?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.4">Bestow this place on us a little while.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN*
>
> <span id="4.1.5">Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!</span>  

<span id="speech3">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.6">What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.7">Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend</span>  
> <span id="4.1.8">Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.9">Behind the arras hearing something stir,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.10">Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a
> rat!'</span>  
> <span id="4.1.11">And, in this brainish apprehension, kills</span>  
> <span id="4.1.12">The unseen good old man.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.13">O heavy deed!</span>  
> <span id="4.1.14">It had been so with us, had we been there:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.15">His liberty is full of threats to all;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.16">To you yourself, to us, to every one.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.17">Alas, how shall this bloody deed be
> answer'd?</span>  
> <span id="4.1.18">It will be laid to us, whose providence</span>  
> <span id="4.1.19">Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of
> haunt,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.20">This mad young man: but so much was our
> love,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.21">We would not understand what was most fit;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.22">But, like the owner of a foul disease,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.23">To keep it from divulging, let it feed</span>  
> <span id="4.1.24">Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.25">To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.26">O'er whom his very madness, like some ore</span>  
> <span id="4.1.27">Among a mineral of metals base,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.28">Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is
> done.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.29">O Gertrude, come away!</span>  
> <span id="4.1.30">The sun no sooner shall the mountains
> touch,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.31">But we will ship him hence: and this vile
> deed</span>  
> <span id="4.1.32">We must, with all our majesty and skill,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.33">Both countenance and excuse. Ho,
> Guildenstern!</span>  
>
> *Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN*
>
> <span id="4.1.34">Friends both, go join you with some further
> aid:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.35">Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.36">And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd
> him:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.37">Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the
> body</span>  
> <span id="4.1.38">Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN*
>
> <span id="4.1.39">Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest
> friends;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.40">And let them know, both what we mean to do,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.41">And what's untimely done. O, come away!</span>  
> <span id="4.1.42">My soul is full of discord and dismay.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
