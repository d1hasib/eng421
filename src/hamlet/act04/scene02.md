> *Enter HAMLET*

<span id="speech1">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.2.1">Safely stowed.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**ROSENCRANTZ:**</span> <span
id="speech3">**GUILDENSTERN:**</span>

> <span id="4.2.2">\[Within\] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!</span>  

<span id="speech4">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.2.3">What noise? who calls on Hamlet?</span>  
> <span id="4.2.4">O, here they come.</span>  
>
> *Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN*

<span id="speech5">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="4.2.5">What have you done, my lord, with the dead
> body?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.2.6">Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="4.2.7">Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it
> thence</span>  
> <span id="4.2.8">And bear it to the chapel.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.2.9">Do not believe it.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="4.2.10">Believe what?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.2.11">That I can keep your counsel and not mine
> own.</span>  
> <span id="4.2.12">Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what</span>  
> <span id="4.2.13">replication should be made by the son of a
> king?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="4.2.14">Take you me for a sponge, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.2.15">Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance,
> his</span>  
> <span id="4.2.16">rewards, his authorities. But such officers do
> the</span>  
> <span id="4.2.17">king best service in the end: he keeps them,
> like</span>  
> <span id="4.2.18">an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed,
> to</span>  
> <span id="4.2.19">be last swallowed: when he needs what you
> have</span>  
> <span id="4.2.20">gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge,
> you</span>  
> <span id="4.2.21">shall be dry again.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="4.2.22">I understand you not, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.2.23">I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in
> a</span>  
> <span id="4.2.24">foolish ear.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="4.2.25">My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and
> go</span>  
> <span id="4.2.26">with us to the king.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.2.27">The body is with the king, but the king is not
> with</span>  
> <span id="4.2.28">the body. The king is a thing--</span>  

<span id="speech17">**GUILDENSTERN**</span>

> <span id="4.2.29">A thing, my lord!</span>  

<span id="speech18">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="4.2.30">Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all
> after.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
