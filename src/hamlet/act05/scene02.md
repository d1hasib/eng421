## SCENE II

### A hall in the castle.

> *Enter HAMLET and HORATIO*

<span id="speech1">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.1">So much for this, sir: now shall you see the
> other;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.2">You do remember all the circumstance?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.3">Remember it, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech3">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.4">Sir, in my heart there was a kind of
> fighting,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.5">That would not let me sleep: methought I lay</span>  
> <span id="5.2.6">Worse than the mutines in the bilboes.
> Rashly,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.7">And praised be rashness for it, let us know,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.8">Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.9">When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach
> us</span>  
> <span id="5.2.10">There's a divinity that shapes our ends,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.11">Rough-hew them how we will,--</span>  

<span id="speech4">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.12">That is most certain.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.13">Up from my cabin,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.14">My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark</span>  
> <span id="5.2.15">Groped I to find out them; had my desire.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.16">Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew</span>  
> <span id="5.2.17">To mine own room again; making so bold,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.18">My fears forgetting manners, to unseal</span>  
> <span id="5.2.19">Their grand commission; where I found,
> Horatio,--</span>  
> <span id="5.2.20">O royal knavery!--an exact command,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.21">Larded with many several sorts of reasons</span>  
> <span id="5.2.22">Importing Denmark's health and England's
> too,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.23">With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.24">That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.25">No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.26">My head should be struck off.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.27">Is't possible?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.28">Here's the commission: read it at more
> leisure.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.29">But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.30">I beseech you.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.31">Being thus be-netted round with
> villanies,--</span>  
> <span id="5.2.32">Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.33">They had begun the play--I sat me down,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.34">Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.35">I once did hold it, as our statists do,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.36">A baseness to write fair and labour'd much</span>  
> <span id="5.2.37">How to forget that learning, but, sir, now</span>  
> <span id="5.2.38">It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know</span>  
> <span id="5.2.39">The effect of what I wrote?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.40">Ay, good my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.41">An earnest conjuration from the king,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.42">As England was his faithful tributary,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.43">As love between them like the palm might
> flourish,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.44">As peace should stiff her wheaten garland
> wear</span>  
> <span id="5.2.45">And stand a comma 'tween their amities,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.46">And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.47">That, on the view and knowing of these
> contents,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.48">Without debatement further, more or less,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.49">He should the bearers put to sudden death,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.50">Not shriving-time allow'd.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.51">How was this seal'd?</span>  

<span id="speech13">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.52">Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.53">I had my father's signet in my purse,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.54">Which was the model of that Danish seal;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.55">Folded the writ up in form of the other,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.56">Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it
> safely,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.57">The changeling never known. Now, the next
> day</span>  
> <span id="5.2.58">Was our sea-fight; and what to this was
> sequent</span>  
> <span id="5.2.59">Thou know'st already.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.60">So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.61">Why, man, they did make love to this
> employment;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.62">They are not near my conscience; their
> defeat</span>  
> <span id="5.2.63">Does by their own insinuation grow:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.64">'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes</span>  
> <span id="5.2.65">Between the pass and fell incensed points</span>  
> <span id="5.2.66">Of mighty opposites.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.67">Why, what a king is this!</span>  

<span id="speech17">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.68">Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now
> upon--</span>  
> <span id="5.2.69">He that hath kill'd my king and whored my
> mother,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.70">Popp'd in between the election and my
> hopes,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.71">Thrown out his angle for my proper life,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.72">And with such cozenage--is't not perfect
> conscience,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.73">To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be
> damn'd,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.74">To let this canker of our nature come</span>  
> <span id="5.2.75">In further evil?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.76">It must be shortly known to him from
> England</span>  
> <span id="5.2.77">What is the issue of the business there.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.78">It will be short: the interim is mine;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.79">And a man's life's no more than to say
> 'One.'</span>  
> <span id="5.2.80">But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.81">That to Laertes I forgot myself;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.82">For, by the image of my cause, I see</span>  
> <span id="5.2.83">The portraiture of his: I'll court his
> favours.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.84">But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put
> me</span>  
> <span id="5.2.85">Into a towering passion.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.86">Peace! who comes here?</span>  
>
> *Enter OSRIC*

<span id="speech21">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.87">Your lordship is right welcome back to
> Denmark.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.88">I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this
> water-fly?</span>  

<span id="speech23">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.89">No, my good lord.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.90">Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice
> to</span>  
> <span id="5.2.91">know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let
> a</span>  
> <span id="5.2.92">beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand
> at</span>  
> <span id="5.2.93">the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I
> say,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.94">spacious in the possession of dirt.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.95">Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure,
> I</span>  
> <span id="5.2.96">should impart a thing to you from his
> majesty.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.97">I will receive it, sir, with all diligence
> of</span>  
> <span id="5.2.98">spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for
> the head.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.99">I thank your lordship, it is very hot.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.100">No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind
> is</span>  
> <span id="5.2.101">northerly.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.102">It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.103">But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for
> my</span>  
> <span id="5.2.104">complexion.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.105">Exceedingly, my lord; it is very
> sultry,--as</span>  
> <span id="5.2.106">'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord,
> his</span>  
> <span id="5.2.107">majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid
> a</span>  
> <span id="5.2.108">great wager on your head: sir, this is the
> matter,--</span>  

<span id="speech32">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.109">I beseech you, remember--</span>  
>
> *HAMLET moves him to put on his hat*

<span id="speech33">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.110">Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good
> faith.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.111">Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes;
> believe</span>  
> <span id="5.2.112">me, an absolute gentleman, full of most
> excellent</span>  
> <span id="5.2.113">differences, of very soft society and great
> showing:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.114">indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card
> or</span>  
> <span id="5.2.115">calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him
> the</span>  
> <span id="5.2.116">continent of what part a gentleman would
> see.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.117">Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in
> you;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.118">though, I know, to divide him inventorially
> would</span>  
> <span id="5.2.119">dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but
> yaw</span>  
> <span id="5.2.120">neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in
> the</span>  
> <span id="5.2.121">verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul
> of</span>  
> <span id="5.2.122">great article; and his infusion of such dearth
> and</span>  
> <span id="5.2.123">rareness, as, to make true diction of him,
> his</span>  
> <span id="5.2.124">semblable is his mirror; and who else would
> trace</span>  
> <span id="5.2.125">him, his umbrage, nothing more.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.126">Your lordship speaks most infallibly of
> him.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.127">The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the
> gentleman</span>  
> <span id="5.2.128">in our more rawer breath?</span>  

<span id="speech37">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.129">Sir?</span>  

<span id="speech38">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.130">Is't not possible to understand in another
> tongue?</span>  
> <span id="5.2.131">You will do't, sir, really.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.132">What imports the nomination of this
> gentleman?</span>  

<span id="speech40">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.133">Of Laertes?</span>  

<span id="speech41">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.134">His purse is empty already; all's golden words are
> spent.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.135">Of him, sir.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.136">I know you are not ignorant--</span>  

<span id="speech44">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.137">I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you
> did,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.138">it would not much approve me. Well, sir?</span>  

<span id="speech45">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.139">You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes
> is--</span>  

<span id="speech46">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.140">I dare not confess that, lest I should compare
> with</span>  
> <span id="5.2.141">him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were
> to</span>  
> <span id="5.2.142">know himself.</span>  

<span id="speech47">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.143">I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the
> imputation</span>  
> <span id="5.2.144">laid on him by them, in his meed he's
> unfellowed.</span>  

<span id="speech48">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.145">What's his weapon?</span>  

<span id="speech49">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.146">Rapier and dagger.</span>  

<span id="speech50">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.147">That's two of his weapons: but, well.</span>  

<span id="speech51">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.148">The king, sir, hath wagered with him six
> Barbary</span>  
> <span id="5.2.149">horses: against the which he has imponed, as I
> take</span>  
> <span id="5.2.150">it, six French rapiers and poniards, with
> their</span>  
> <span id="5.2.151">assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of
> the</span>  
> <span id="5.2.152">carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
> very</span>  
> <span id="5.2.153">responsive to the hilts, most delicate
> carriages,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.154">and of very liberal conceit.</span>  

<span id="speech52">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.155">What call you the carriages?</span>  

<span id="speech53">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.156">I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you
> had done.</span>  

<span id="speech54">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.157">The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</span>  

<span id="speech55">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.158">The phrase would be more german to the matter, if
> we</span>  
> <span id="5.2.159">could carry cannon by our sides: I would it
> might</span>  
> <span id="5.2.160">be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary
> horses</span>  
> <span id="5.2.161">against six French swords, their assigns, and
> three</span>  
> <span id="5.2.162">liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French
> bet</span>  
> <span id="5.2.163">against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you
> call it?</span>  

<span id="speech56">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.164">The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen
> passes</span>  
> <span id="5.2.165">between yourself and him, he shall not exceed
> you</span>  
> <span id="5.2.166">three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and
> it</span>  
> <span id="5.2.167">would come to immediate trial, if your
> lordship</span>  
> <span id="5.2.168">would vouchsafe the answer.</span>  

<span id="speech57">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.169">How if I answer 'no'?</span>  

<span id="speech58">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.170">I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in
> trial.</span>  

<span id="speech59">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.171">Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please
> his</span>  
> <span id="5.2.172">majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me;
> let</span>  
> <span id="5.2.173">the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and
> the</span>  
> <span id="5.2.174">king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I
> can;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.175">if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the
> odd hits.</span>  

<span id="speech60">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.176">Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?</span>  

<span id="speech61">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.177">To this effect, sir; after what flourish your
> nature will.</span>  

<span id="speech62">**OSRIC**</span>

> <span id="5.2.178">I commend my duty to your lordship.</span>  

<span id="speech63">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.179">Yours, yours.</span>  
>
> *Exit OSRIC*
>
> <span id="5.2.180">He does well to commend it himself; there are

> <span id="5.2.181">tongues else for's turn.</span>  

<span id="speech64">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.182">This lapwing runs away with the shell on his

<span id="speech65">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.183">He did comply with his dug, before he sucked

> <span id="5.2.185">know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune

> <span id="5.2.186">the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind

> <span id="5.2.187">yesty collection, which carries them through

>
> *Enter a Lord*

<span id="speech66">**Lord**</span>

> <span id="5.2.190">My lord, his majesty commended him to you by

> <span id="5.2.191">Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him

<span id="speech67">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.194">I am constant to my purpose; they follow the

<span id="speech68">**Lord**</span>

<span id="speech69">**HAMLET**</span>

<span id="speech70">**Lord**</span>

> <span id="5.2.199">The queen desires you to use some gentle</span>

<span id="speech71">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.201">She well instructs me.</span>

> *Exit Lord*

<span id="speech72">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.202">You will lose this wager, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech73">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.203">I do not think so: since he went into France,
> I</span>  
> <span id="5.2.204">have been in continual practise: I shall win at

> <span id="5.2.205">odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's

> <span id="5.2.206">about my heart: but it is no matter.</span>  

<span id="speech74">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.207">Nay, good my lord,--</span>  

<span id="speech75">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.208">It is but foolery; but it is such a kind
> of</span>  
> <span id="5.2.209">gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a

<span id="speech76">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.2.210">If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I

> <span id="5.2.211">forestall their repair hither, and say you are

> <span id="5.2.212">fit.</span>  

<span id="speech77">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.2.213">Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a
