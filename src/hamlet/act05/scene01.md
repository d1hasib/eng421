### A churchyard.

> *Enter two Clowns, with spades, & c*

<span id="speech1">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.1">Is she to be buried in Christian burial that</span>  
> <span id="5.1.2">wilfully seeks her own salvation?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Second Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.3">I tell thee she is: and therefore make her
> grave</span>  
> <span id="5.1.4">straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds
> it</span>  
> <span id="5.1.5">Christian burial.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.6">How can that be, unless she drowned herself in
> her</span>  
> <span id="5.1.7">own defence?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Second Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.8">Why, 'tis found so.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.9">It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else.
> For</span>  
> <span id="5.1.10">here lies the point: if I drown myself
> wittingly,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.11">it argues an act: and an act hath three branches:
> it</span>  
> <span id="5.1.12">is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she
> drowned</span>  
> <span id="5.1.13">herself wittingly.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Second Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.14">Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--</span>  

<span id="speech7">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.15">Give me leave. Here lies the water; good:
> here</span>  
> <span id="5.1.16">stands the man; good; if the man go to this
> water,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.17">and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he,
> he</span>  
> <span id="5.1.18">goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to
> him</span>  
> <span id="5.1.19">and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal,
> he</span>  
> <span id="5.1.20">that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his
> own life.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**Second Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.21">But is this law?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.22">Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**Second Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.23">Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not
> been</span>  
> <span id="5.1.24">a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out
> o'</span>  
> <span id="5.1.25">Christian burial.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.26">Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity
> that</span>  
> <span id="5.1.27">great folk should have countenance in this world
> to</span>  
> <span id="5.1.28">drown or hang themselves, more than their
> even</span>  
> <span id="5.1.29">Christian. Come, my spade. There is no
> ancient</span>  
> <span id="5.1.30">gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and
> grave-makers:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.31">they hold up Adam's profession.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**Second Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.32">Was he a gentleman?</span>  

<span id="speech13">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.33">He was the first that ever bore arms.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**Second Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.34">Why, he had none.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.35">What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand
> the</span>  
> <span id="5.1.36">Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam
> digged:'</span>  
> <span id="5.1.37">could he dig without arms? I'll put another</span>  
> <span id="5.1.38">question to thee: if thou answerest me not to
> the</span>  
> <span id="5.1.39">purpose, confess thyself--</span>  

<span id="speech16">**Second Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.40">Go to.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.41">What is he that builds stronger than either
> the</span>  
> <span id="5.1.42">mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**Second Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.43">The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives
> a</span>  
> <span id="5.1.44">thousand tenants.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.45">I like thy wit well, in good faith: the
> gallows</span>  
> <span id="5.1.46">does well; but how does it well? it does well
> to</span>  
> <span id="5.1.47">those that do in: now thou dost ill to say
> the</span>  
> <span id="5.1.48">gallows is built stronger than the church:
> argal,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.49">the gallows may do well to thee. To't again,
> come.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**Second Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.50">'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright,
> or</span>  
> <span id="5.1.51">a carpenter?'</span>  

<span id="speech21">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.52">Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**Second Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.53">Marry, now I can tell.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.54">To't.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**Second Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.55">Mass, I cannot tell.</span>  
>
> *Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance*

<span id="speech25">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.56">Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your
> dull</span>  
> <span id="5.1.57">ass will not mend his pace with beating; and,

> <span id="5.1.58">you are asked this question next, say 'a</span>

> *He digs and sings*

> <span id="5.1.62">In youth, when I did love, did love,</span>

<span id="speech26">**HAMLET**</span>

<span id="speech27">**HORATIO**</span>

<span id="speech28">**HAMLET**</span>

<span id="speech29">**First Clown**</span>

> <span id="5.1.71">\[Sings\]</span>

> *Throws up a skull*

<span id="speech30">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="5.1.76">That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing

<span id="speech31">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="5.1.82">It might, my lord.</span>

<span id="speech40">**HAMLET**</span>

<span id="speech58">**HAMLET**</span>
