## SCENE I

### A room in the castle.

> *Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ,
> and GUILDENSTERN*

<span id="speech1">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.1">And can you, by no drift of circumstance,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.2">Get from him why he puts on this confusion,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.3">Grating so harshly all his days of quiet</span>  
> <span id="3.1.4">With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="3.1.5">He does confess he feels himself distracted;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.6">But from what cause he will by no means
> speak.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**GUILDENSTERN**</span>

> <span id="3.1.7">Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.8">But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.9">When we would bring him on to some
> confession</span>  
> <span id="3.1.10">Of his true state.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.11">Did he receive you well?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="3.1.12">Most like a gentleman.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**GUILDENSTERN**</span>

> <span id="3.1.13">But with much forcing of his disposition.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="3.1.14">Niggard of question; but, of our demands,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.15">Most free in his reply.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.16">Did you assay him?</span>  
> <span id="3.1.17">To any pastime?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="3.1.18">Madam, it so fell out, that certain players</span>  
> <span id="3.1.19">We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told
> him;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.20">And there did seem in him a kind of joy</span>  
> <span id="3.1.21">To hear of it: they are about the court,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.22">And, as I think, they have already order</span>  
> <span id="3.1.23">This night to play before him.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.24">'Tis most true:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.25">And he beseech'd me to entreat your
> majesties</span>  
> <span id="3.1.26">To hear and see the matter.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.27">With all my heart; and it doth much content
> me</span>  
> <span id="3.1.28">To hear him so inclined.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.29">Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.30">And drive his purpose on to these delights.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="3.1.31">We shall, my lord.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN*

<span id="speech13">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.32">Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.33">For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.34">That he, as 'twere by accident, may here</span>  
> <span id="3.1.35">Affront Ophelia:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.36">Her father and myself, lawful espials,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.37">Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing,
> unseen,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.38">We may of their encounter frankly judge,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.39">And gather by him, as he is behaved,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.40">If 't be the affliction of his love or no</span>  
> <span id="3.1.41">That thus he suffers for.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.42">I shall obey you.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.43">And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish</span>  
> <span id="3.1.44">That your good beauties be the happy cause</span>  
> <span id="3.1.45">Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your
> virtues</span>  
> <span id="3.1.46">Will bring him to his wonted way again,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.47">To both your honours.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.48">Madam, I wish it may.</span>  
>
> *Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE*

<span id="speech16">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.49">Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please
> you,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.50">We will bestow ourselves.</span>  
>
> *To OPHELIA*
>
> <span id="3.1.51">Read on this book;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.52">That show of such an exercise may colour</span>  
> <span id="3.1.53">Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in
> this,--</span>  
> <span id="3.1.54">'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's
> visage</span>  
> <span id="3.1.55">And pious action we do sugar o'er</span>  
> <span id="3.1.56">The devil himself.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.57">\[Aside\] O, 'tis too true!</span>  
> <span id="3.1.58">How smart a lash that speech doth give my
> conscience!</span>  
> <span id="3.1.59">The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering
> art,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.60">Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it</span>  
> <span id="3.1.61">Than is my deed to my most painted word:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.62">O heavy burthen!</span>  

<span id="speech18">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.63">I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS*
>
> *Enter HAMLET*

<span id="speech19">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.1.64">To be, or not to be, that is the question,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.65">Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</span>  
> <span id="3.1.66">The slings and arrows of outrageous
> fortune,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.67">Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.68">And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.69">No more; and by a sleep to say we end</span>  
> <span id="3.1.70">The heart-ache and the thousand natural
> shocks</span>  
> <span id="3.1.71">That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation</span>  
> <span id="3.1.72">Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.73">To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the
> rub;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.74">For in that sleep of death what dreams may
> come</span>  
> <span id="3.1.75">When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.76">Must give us pause: there's the respect</span>  
> <span id="3.1.77">That makes calamity of so long life;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.78">For who would bear the whips and scorns of
> time,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.79">The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's
> contumely,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.80">The pangs of despised love, the law's
> delay,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.81">The insolence of office and the spurns</span>  
> <span id="3.1.82">That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.83">When he himself might his quietus make</span>  
> <span id="3.1.84">With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.85">To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.86">But that the dread of something after
> death,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.87">The undiscover'd country from whose bourn</span>  
> <span id="3.1.88">No traveller returns, puzzles the will</span>  
> <span id="3.1.89">And makes us rather bear those ills we have</span>  
> <span id="3.1.90">Than fly to others that we know not of?</span>  
> <span id="3.1.91">Thus conscience does make cowards of us
> all;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.92">And thus the native hue of resolution</span>  
> <span id="3.1.93">Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of
> thought,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.94">And enterprises of great pith and moment</span>  
> <span id="3.1.95">With this regard their currents turn awry,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.96">And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!</span>  
> <span id="3.1.97">The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons</span>  
> <span id="3.1.98">Be all my sins remember'd.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.99">Good my lord,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.100">How does your honour for this many a day?</span>  

<span id="speech21">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.1.101">I humbly thank you; well, well, well.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.102">My lord, I have remembrances of yours,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.103">That I have longed long to re-deliver;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.104">I pray you, now receive them.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.1.105">No, not I;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.106">I never gave you aught.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.107">My honour'd lord, you know right well you
> did;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.108">And, with them, words of so sweet breath
> composed</span>  
> <span id="3.1.109">As made the things more rich: their perfume
> lost,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.110">Take these again; for to the noble mind</span>  
> <span id="3.1.111">Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove
> unkind.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.112">There, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.1.113">Ha, ha! are you honest?</span>  

<span id="speech26">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.114">My lord?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.1.115">Are you fair?</span>  

<span id="speech28">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.116">What means your lordship?</span>  

<span id="speech29">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.1.117">That if you be honest and fair, your honesty
> should</span>  
> <span id="3.1.118">admit no discourse to your beauty.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.119">Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce
> than</span>  
> <span id="3.1.120">with honesty?</span>  

<span id="speech31">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.1.121">Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will
> sooner</span>  
> <span id="3.1.122">transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than
> the</span>  
> <span id="3.1.123">force of honesty can translate beauty into
> his</span>  
> <span id="3.1.124">likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now
> the</span>  
> <span id="3.1.125">time gives it proof. I did love you once.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.126">Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.1.127">You should not have believed me; for virtue
> cannot</span>  
> <span id="3.1.128">so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish
> of</span>  
> <span id="3.1.129">it: I loved you not.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.130">I was the more deceived.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.1.131">Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be
> a</span>  
> <span id="3.1.132">breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent
> honest;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.133">but yet I could accuse me of such things that
> it</span>  
> <span id="3.1.134">were better my mother had not borne me: I am
> very</span>  
> <span id="3.1.135">proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences
> at</span>  
> <span id="3.1.136">my beck than I have thoughts to put them
> in,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.137">imagination to give them shape, or time to act
> them</span>  
> <span id="3.1.138">in. What should such fellows as I do
> crawling</span>  
> <span id="3.1.139">between earth and heaven? We are arrant
> knaves,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.140">all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a

> <span id="3.1.141">Where's your father?</span>  

<span id="speech36">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.142">At home, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.1.143">Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play
> the</span>  
> <span id="3.1.144">fool no where but in's own house.
> Farewell.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.145">O, help him, you sweet heavens!</span>  

<span id="speech39">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.1.146">If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague
> for</span>  
> <span id="3.1.147">thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure

> <span id="3.1.148">snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to
> a</span>  
> <span id="3.1.149">nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt
> needs</span>  
> <span id="3.1.150">marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well
> enough</span>  
> <span id="3.1.151">what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery,
> go,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.152">and quickly too. Farewell.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.153">O heavenly powers, restore him!</span>  

<span id="speech41">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.1.154">I have heard of your paintings too, well enough;
> God</span>  
> <span id="3.1.155">has given you one face, and you make

> <span id="3.1.156">another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp,

> <span id="3.1.157">nick-name God's creatures, and make your

> <span id="3.1.158">your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it

> <span id="3.1.159">made me mad. I say, we will have no more

> <span id="3.1.160">those that are married already, all but one,

> <span id="3.1.161">live; the rest shall keep as they are. To

> *Exit*

<span id="speech42">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.163">O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!</span>  
> <span id="3.1.164">The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue,
