## SCENE IV

### The Queen's closet.

> *Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUS*

<span id="speech1">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.4.1">He will come straight. Look you lay home to
> him:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.2">Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear
> with,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.3">And that your grace hath screen'd and stood
> between</span>  
> <span id="3.4.4">Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.5">Pray you, be round with him.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.6">\[Within\] Mother, mother, mother!</span>  

<span id="speech3">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.7">I'll warrant you,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.8">Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.</span>  
>
> *POLONIUS hides behind the arras*
>
> *Enter HAMLET*

<span id="speech4">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.9">Now, mother, what's the matter?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.10">Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.11">Mother, you have my father much offended.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.12">Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.13">Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.14">Why, how now, Hamlet!</span>  

<span id="speech10">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.15">What's the matter now?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.16">Have you forgot me?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.17">No, by the rood, not so:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.18">You are the queen, your husband's brother's
> wife;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.19">And--would it were not so!--you are my
> mother.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.20">Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can
> speak.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.21">Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not
> budge;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.22">You go not till I set you up a glass</span>  
> <span id="3.4.23">Where you may see the inmost part of you.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.24">What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?</span>  
> <span id="3.4.25">Help, help, ho!</span>  

<span id="speech16">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.4.26">\[Behind\] What, ho! help, help, help!</span>  

<span id="speech17">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.27">\[Drawing\] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat,
> dead!</span>  
>
> *Makes a pass through the arras*

<span id="speech18">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.4.28">\[Behind\] O, I am slain!</span>  
>
> *Falls and dies*

<span id="speech19">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.29">O me, what hast thou done?</span>  

<span id="speech20">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.30">Nay, I know not:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.31">Is it the king?</span>  

<span id="speech21">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.32">O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!</span>  

<span id="speech22">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.33">A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.34">As kill a king, and marry with his brother.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.35">As kill a king!</span>  

<span id="speech24">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.36">Ay, lady, 'twas my word.</span>  
>
> *Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS*
>
> <span id="3.4.37">Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool,
> farewell!</span>  
> <span id="3.4.38">I took thee for thy better: take thy
> fortune;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.39">Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.40">Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you
> down,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.41">And let me wring your heart; for so I
> shall,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.42">If it be made of penetrable stuff,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.43">If damned custom have not brass'd it so</span>  
> <span id="3.4.44">That it is proof and bulwark against sense.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.45">What have I done, that thou darest wag thy
> tongue</span>  
> <span id="3.4.46">In noise so rude against me?</span>  

<span id="speech26">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.47">Such an act</span>  
> <span id="3.4.48">That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.49">Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose</span>  
> <span id="3.4.50">From the fair forehead of an innocent love</span>  
> <span id="3.4.51">And sets a blister there, makes
> marriage-vows</span>  
> <span id="3.4.52">As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed</span>  
> <span id="3.4.53">As from the body of contraction plucks</span>  
> <span id="3.4.54">The very soul, and sweet religion makes</span>  
> <span id="3.4.55">A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth
> glow:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.56">Yea, this solidity and compound mass,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.57">With tristful visage, as against the doom,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.58">Is thought-sick at the act.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.59">Ay me, what act,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.60">That roars so loud, and thunders in the
> index?</span>  

<span id="speech28">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.61">Look here, upon this picture, and on this,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.62">The counterfeit presentment of two
> brothers.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.63">See, what a grace was seated on this brow;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.64">Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove
> himself;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.65">An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.66">A station like the herald Mercury</span>  
> <span id="3.4.67">New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.68">A combination and a form indeed,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.69">Where every god did seem to set his seal,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.70">To give the world assurance of a man:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.71">This was your husband. Look you now, what
> follows:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.72">Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.73">Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you
> eyes?</span>  
> <span id="3.4.74">Could you on this fair mountain leave to
> feed,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.75">And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?</span>  
> <span id="3.4.76">You cannot call it love; for at your age</span>  
> <span id="3.4.77">The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's
> humble,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.78">And waits upon the judgment: and what
> judgment</span>  
> <span id="3.4.79">Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you
> have,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.80">Else could you not have motion; but sure, that
> sense</span>  
> <span id="3.4.81">Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.82">Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd</span>  
> <span id="3.4.83">But it reserved some quantity of choice,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.84">To serve in such a difference. What devil
> was't</span>  
> <span id="3.4.85">That thus hath cozen'd you at
> hoodman-blind?</span>  
> <span id="3.4.86">Eyes without feeling, feeling without
> sight,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.87">Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans
> all,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.88">Or but a sickly part of one true sense</span>  
> <span id="3.4.89">Could not so mope.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.90">O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious
> hell,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.91">If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.92">To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.93">And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame</span>  
> <span id="3.4.94">When the compulsive ardour gives the
> charge,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.95">Since frost itself as actively doth burn</span>  
> <span id="3.4.96">And reason panders will.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.97">O Hamlet, speak no more:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.98">Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.99">And there I see such black and grained
> spots</span>  
> <span id="3.4.100">As will not leave their tinct.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.101">Nay, but to live</span>  
> <span id="3.4.102">In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.103">Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making
> love</span>  
> <span id="3.4.104">Over the nasty sty,--</span>  

<span id="speech31">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.105">O, speak to me no more;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.106">These words, like daggers, enter in mine
> ears;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.107">No more, sweet Hamlet!</span>  

<span id="speech32">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.108">A murderer and a villain;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.109">A slave that is not twentieth part the
> tithe</span>  
> <span id="3.4.110">Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.111">A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.112">That from a shelf the precious diadem
> stole,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.113">And put it in his pocket!</span>  

<span id="speech33">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.114">No more!</span>  

<span id="speech34">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.115">A king of shreds and patches,--</span>  
>
> *Enter Ghost*
>
> <span id="3.4.116">Save me, and hover o'er me with your
> wings,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.117">You heavenly guards! What would your gracious
> figure?</span>  

<span id="speech35">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.118">Alas, he's mad!</span>  

<span id="speech36">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.119">Do you not come your tardy son to chide,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.120">That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go
> by</span>  
> <span id="3.4.121">The important acting of your dread command? O,
> say!</span>  

<span id="speech37">**Ghost**</span>

> <span id="3.4.122">Do not forget: this visitation</span>  
> <span id="3.4.123">Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.124">But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.125">O, step between her and her fighting soul:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.126">Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.127">Speak to her, Hamlet.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.128">How is it with you, lady?</span>  

<span id="speech39">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.129">Alas, how is't with you,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.130">That you do bend your eye on vacancy</span>  
> <span id="3.4.131">And with the incorporal air do hold
> discourse?</span>  
> <span id="3.4.132">Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly
> peep;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.133">And, as the sleeping soldiers in the
> alarm,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.134">Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.135">Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle
> son,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.136">Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper</span>  
> <span id="3.4.137">Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you
> look?</span>  

<span id="speech40">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.138">On him, on him! Look you, how pale he
> glares!</span>  
> <span id="3.4.139">His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to
> stones,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.140">Would make them capable. Do not look upon
> me;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.141">Lest with this piteous action you convert</span>  
> <span id="3.4.142">My stern effects: then what I have to do</span>  
> <span id="3.4.143">Will want true colour; tears perchance for
> blood.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.144">To whom do you speak this?</span>  

<span id="speech42">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.145">Do you see nothing there?</span>  

<span id="speech43">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.146">Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.</span>  

<span id="speech44">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.147">Nor did you nothing hear?</span>  

<span id="speech45">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.148">No, nothing but ourselves.</span>  

<span id="speech46">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.149">Why, look you there! look, how it steals
> away!</span>  
> <span id="3.4.150">My father, in his habit as he lived!</span>  
> <span id="3.4.151">Look, where he goes, even now, out at the
> portal!</span>  
>
> *Exit Ghost*

<span id="speech47">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.152">This the very coinage of your brain:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.153">This bodiless creation ecstasy</span>  
> <span id="3.4.154">Is very cunning in.</span>  

<span id="speech48">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.155">Ecstasy!</span>  
> <span id="3.4.156">My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep
> time,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.157">And makes as healthful music: it is not
> madness</span>  
> <span id="3.4.158">That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.159">And I the matter will re-word; which
> madness</span>  
> <span id="3.4.160">Would gambol from. Mother, for love of
> grace,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.161">Lay not that mattering unction to your
> soul,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.162">That not your trespass, but my madness
> speaks:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.163">It will but skin and film the ulcerous
> place,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.164">Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.165">Infects unseen. Confess yourself to
> heaven;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.166">Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.167">And do not spread the compost on the
> weeds,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.168">To make them ranker. Forgive me this my
> virtue;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.169">For in the fatness of these pursy times</span>  
> <span id="3.4.170">Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.171">Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him
> good.</span>  

<span id="speech49">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.172">O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in
> twain.</span>  

<span id="speech50">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.173">O, throw away the worser part of it,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.174">And live the purer with the other half.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.175">Good night: but go not to mine uncle's
> bed;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.176">Assume a virtue, if you have it not.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.177">That monster, custom, who all sense doth
> eat,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.178">Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.179">That to the use of actions fair and good</span>  
> <span id="3.4.180">He likewise gives a frock or livery,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.181">That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.182">And that shall lend a kind of easiness</span>  
> <span id="3.4.183">To the next abstinence: the next more
> easy;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.184">For use almost can change the stamp of
> nature,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.185">And either \[ \] the devil, or throw him
> out</span>  
> <span id="3.4.186">With wondrous potency. Once more, good
> night:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.187">And when you are desirous to be bless'd,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.188">I'll blessing beg of you. For this same

>
> *Pointing to POLONIUS*
>
> <span id="3.4.189">I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it

> <span id="3.4.190">To punish me with this and this with me,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.191">That I must be their scourge and minister.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.192">I will bestow him, and will answer well</span>  
> <span id="3.4.193">The death I gave him. So, again, good

> <span id="3.4.194">I must be cruel, only to be kind:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.195">Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.196">One word more, good lady.</span>  

<span id="speech51">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.197">What shall I do?</span>  

<span id="speech52">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.198">Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.199">Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.200">Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his
> mouse;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.201">And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.202">Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd
> fingers,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.203">Make you to ravel all this matter out,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.204">That I essentially am not in madness,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.205">But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him

> <span id="3.4.206">For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober,
> wise,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.207">Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.208">Such dear concernings hide? who would do

> <span id="3.4.209">No, in despite of sense and secrecy,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.210">Unpeg the basket on the house's top.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.211">Let the birds fly, and, like the famous
> ape,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.212">To try conclusions, in the basket creep,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.213">And break your own neck down.</span>  

<span id="speech53">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.214">Be thou assured, if words be made of
> breath,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.215">And breath of life, I have no life to

> <span id="3.4.216">What thou hast said to me.</span>  

<span id="speech54">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.217">I must to England; you know that?</span>  

<span id="speech55">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.4.218">Alack,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.219">I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.</span>  

<span id="speech56">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.4.220">There's letters seal'd: and my two

> <span id="3.4.221">Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.222">They bear the mandate; they must sweep my

> <span id="3.4.223">And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.224">For 'tis the sport to have the engineer</span>  
> <span id="3.4.225">Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go

> <span id="3.4.226">But I will delve one yard below their

> <span id="3.4.227">And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most

> <span id="3.4.228">When in one line two crafts directly meet.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.229">This man shall set me packing:</span>
