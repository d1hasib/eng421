## SCENE III

### A room in the castle.

> *Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN*

<span id="speech1">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.3.1">I like him not, nor stands it safe with us</span>  
> <span id="3.3.2">To let his madness range. Therefore prepare
> you;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.3">I your commission will forthwith dispatch,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.4">And he to England shall along with you:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.5">The terms of our estate may not endure</span>  
> <span id="3.3.6">Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow</span>  
> <span id="3.3.7">Out of his lunacies.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**GUILDENSTERN**</span>

> <span id="3.3.8">We will ourselves provide:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.9">Most holy and religious fear it is</span>  
> <span id="3.3.10">To keep those many many bodies safe</span>  
> <span id="3.3.11">That live and feed upon your majesty.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="3.3.12">The single and peculiar life is bound,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.13">With all the strength and armour of the
> mind,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.14">To keep itself from noyance; but much more</span>  
> <span id="3.3.15">That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest</span>  
> <span id="3.3.16">The lives of many. The cease of majesty</span>  
> <span id="3.3.17">Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw</span>  
> <span id="3.3.18">What's near it with it: it is a massy
> wheel,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.19">Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.20">To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser
> things</span>  
> <span id="3.3.21">Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it
> falls,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.22">Each small annexment, petty consequence,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.23">Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone</span>  
> <span id="3.3.24">Did the king sigh, but with a general
> groan.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.3.25">Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.26">For we will fetters put upon this fear,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.27">Which now goes too free-footed.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span> <span
id="speech6">**GUILDENSTERN**</span>

> <span id="3.3.28">We will haste us.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN*
>
> *Enter POLONIUS*

<span id="speech7">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.3.29">My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.30">Behind the arras I'll convey myself,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.31">To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him
> home:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.32">And, as you said, and wisely was it said,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.33">'Tis meet that some more audience than a
> mother,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.34">Since nature makes them partial, should
> o'erhear</span>  
> <span id="3.3.35">The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my
> liege:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.36">I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.37">And tell you what I know.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.3.38">Thanks, dear my lord.</span>  
>
> *Exit POLONIUS*
>
> <span id="3.3.39">O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.40">It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.41">A brother's murder. Pray can I not,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.42">Though inclination be as sharp as will:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.43">My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.44">And, like a man to double business bound,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.45">I stand in pause where I shall first begin,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.46">And both neglect. What if this cursed hand</span>  
> <span id="3.3.47">Were thicker than itself with brother's
> blood,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.48">Is there not rain enough in the sweet
> heavens</span>  
> <span id="3.3.49">To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves
> mercy</span>  
> <span id="3.3.50">But to confront the visage of offence?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.51">And what's in prayer but this two-fold
> force,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.52">To be forestalled ere we come to fall,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.53">Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.54">My fault is past. But, O, what form of
> prayer</span>  
> <span id="3.3.55">Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul
> murder'?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.56">That cannot be; since I am still possess'd</span>  
> <span id="3.3.57">Of those effects for which I did the
> murder,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.58">My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.59">May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.60">In the corrupted currents of this world</span>  
> <span id="3.3.61">Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.62">And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself</span>  
> <span id="3.3.63">Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.64">There is no shuffling, there the action
> lies</span>  
> <span id="3.3.65">In his true nature; and we ourselves
> compell'd,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.66">Even to the teeth and forehead of our
> faults,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.67">To give in evidence. What then? what rests?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.68">Try what repentance can: what can it not?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.69">Yet what can it when one can not repent?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.70">O wretched state! O bosom black as death!</span>  
> <span id="3.3.71">O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.72">Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!</span>  
> <span id="3.3.73">Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of
> steel,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.74">Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!</span>  
> <span id="3.3.75">All may be well.</span>  
>
> *Retires and kneels*
>
> *Enter HAMLET*

<span id="speech9">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.3.76">Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.77">And now I'll do't. And so he goes to
> heaven;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.78">And so am I revenged. That would be
> scann'd:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.79">A villain kills my father; and for that,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.80">I, his sole son, do this same villain send</span>  
> <span id="3.3.81">To heaven.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.82">O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.83">He took my father grossly, full of bread;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.84">With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as
> May;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.85">And how his audit stands who knows save
> heaven?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.86">But in our circumstance and course of
> thought,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.87">'Tis heavy with him: and am I then
> revenged,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.88">To take him in the purging of his soul,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.89">When he is fit and season'd for his
> passage?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.90">No!</span>  
> <span id="3.3.91">Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid
> hent:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.92">When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.93">Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.94">At gaming, swearing, or about some act</span>  
> <span id="3.3.95">That has no relish of salvation in't;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.96">Then trip him, that his heels may kick at
> heaven,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.97">And that his soul may be as damn'd and
> black</span>  
> <span id="3.3.98">As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.99">This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech10">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.3.100">\[Rising\] My words fly up, my thoughts remain

> <span id="3.3.101">Words without thoughts never to heaven go.</span>  
>
> *Exit*
