## SCENE II

### A hall in the castle.

> *Enter HAMLET and Players*

<span id="speech1">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.1">Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it
> to</span>  
> <span id="3.2.2">you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth
> it,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.3">as many of your players do, I had as lief
> the</span>  
> <span id="3.2.4">town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the
> air</span>  
> <span id="3.2.5">too much with your hand, thus, but use all
> gently;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.6">for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may
> say,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.7">the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and
> beget</span>  
> <span id="3.2.8">a temperance that may give it smoothness. O,
> it</span>  
> <span id="3.2.9">offends me to the soul to hear a robustious</span>  
> <span id="3.2.10">periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters,
> to</span>  
> <span id="3.2.11">very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings,
> who</span>  
> <span id="3.2.12">for the most part are capable of nothing
> but</span>  
> <span id="3.2.13">inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have
> such</span>  
> <span id="3.2.14">a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant;
> it</span>  
> <span id="3.2.15">out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**First Player**</span>

> <span id="3.2.16">I warrant your honour.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.17">Be not too tame neither, but let your own
> discretion</span>  
> <span id="3.2.18">be your tutor: suit the action to the word,
> the</span>  
> <span id="3.2.19">word to the action; with this special o'erstep
> not</span>  
> <span id="3.2.20">the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone
> is</span>  
> <span id="3.2.21">from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at
> the</span>  
> <span id="3.2.22">first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere,
> the</span>  
> <span id="3.2.23">mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own
> feature,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.24">scorn her own image, and the very age and body
> of</span>  
> <span id="3.2.25">the time his form and pressure. Now this
> overdone,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.26">or come tardy off, though it make the
> unskilful</span>  
> <span id="3.2.27">laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve;
> the</span>  
> <span id="3.2.28">censure of the which one must in your
> allowance</span>  
> <span id="3.2.29">o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there
> be</span>  
> <span id="3.2.30">players that I have seen play, and heard
> others</span>  
> <span id="3.2.31">praise, and that highly, not to speak it
> profanely,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.32">that, neither having the accent of Christians
> nor</span>  
> <span id="3.2.33">the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
> so</span>  
> <span id="3.2.34">strutted and bellowed that I have thought some
> of</span>  
> <span id="3.2.35">nature's journeymen had made men and not made
> them</span>  
> <span id="3.2.36">well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**First Player**</span>

> <span id="3.2.37">I hope we have reformed that indifferently with
> us,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.38">sir.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.39">O, reform it altogether. And let those that
> play</span>  
> <span id="3.2.40">your clowns speak no more than is set down for
> them;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.41">for there be of them that will themselves laugh,
> to</span>  
> <span id="3.2.42">set on some quantity of barren spectators to
> laugh</span>  
> <span id="3.2.43">too; though, in the mean time, some
> necessary</span>  
> <span id="3.2.44">question of the play be then to be
> considered:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.45">that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful
> ambition</span>  
> <span id="3.2.46">in the fool that uses it. Go, make you
> ready.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt Players*
>
> *Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN*
>
> <span id="3.2.47">How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of
> work?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.48">And the queen too, and that presently.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.49">Bid the players make haste.</span>  
>
> *Exit POLONIUS*
>
> <span id="3.2.50">Will you two help to hasten them?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span> <span
id="speech9">**GUILDENSTERN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.51">We will, my lord.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN*

<span id="speech10">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.52">What ho! Horatio!</span>  
>
> *Enter HORATIO*

<span id="speech11">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.53">Here, sweet lord, at your service.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.54">Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man</span>  
> <span id="3.2.55">As e'er my conversation coped withal.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.56">O, my dear lord,--</span>  

<span id="speech14">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.57">Nay, do not think I flatter;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.58">For what advancement may I hope from thee</span>  
> <span id="3.2.59">That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.60">To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be
> flatter'd?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.61">No, let the candied tongue lick absurd
> pomp,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.62">And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee</span>  
> <span id="3.2.63">Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou
> hear?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.64">Since my dear soul was mistress of her
> choice</span>  
> <span id="3.2.65">And could of men distinguish, her election</span>  
> <span id="3.2.66">Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast
> been</span>  
> <span id="3.2.67">As one, in suffering all, that suffers
> nothing,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.68">A man that fortune's buffets and rewards</span>  
> <span id="3.2.69">Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are
> those</span>  
> <span id="3.2.70">Whose blood and judgment are so well
> commingled,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.71">That they are not a pipe for fortune's
> finger</span>  
> <span id="3.2.72">To sound what stop she please. Give me that
> man</span>  
> <span id="3.2.73">That is not passion's slave, and I will wear
> him</span>  
> <span id="3.2.74">In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of
> heart,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.75">As I do thee.--Something too much of
> this.--</span>  
> <span id="3.2.76">There is a play to-night before the king;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.77">One scene of it comes near the circumstance</span>  
> <span id="3.2.78">Which I have told thee of my father's
> death:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.79">I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.80">Even with the very comment of thy soul</span>  
> <span id="3.2.81">Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt</span>  
> <span id="3.2.82">Do not itself unkennel in one speech,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.83">It is a damned ghost that we have seen,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.84">And my imaginations are as foul</span>  
> <span id="3.2.85">As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.86">For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.87">And after we will both our judgments join</span>  
> <span id="3.2.88">In censure of his seeming.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.89">Well, my lord:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.90">If he steal aught the whilst this play is
> playing,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.91">And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.92">They are coming to the play; I must be
> idle:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.93">Get you a place.</span>  
>
> *Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE,
> POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others*

<span id="speech17">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.94">How fares our cousin Hamlet?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.95">Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I
> eat</span>  
> <span id="3.2.96">the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons
> so.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.97">I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these
> words</span>  
> <span id="3.2.98">are not mine.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.99">No, nor mine now.</span>  
>
> *To POLONIUS*
>
> <span id="3.2.100">My lord, you played once i' the university, you
> say?</span>  

<span id="speech21">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.101">That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good
> actor.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.102">What did you enact?</span>  

<span id="speech23">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.103">I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i'
> the</span>  
> <span id="3.2.104">Capitol; Brutus killed me.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.105">It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a
> calf</span>  
> <span id="3.2.106">there. Be the players ready?</span>  

<span id="speech25">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="3.2.107">Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="3.2.108">Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.109">No, good mother, here's metal more
> attractive.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.110">\[To KING CLAUDIUS\] O, ho! do you mark
> that?</span>  

<span id="speech29">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.111">Lady, shall I lie in your lap?</span>  
>
> *Lying down at OPHELIA's feet*

<span id="speech30">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.112">No, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.113">I mean, my head upon your lap?</span>  

<span id="speech32">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.114">Ay, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.115">Do you think I meant country matters?</span>  

<span id="speech34">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.116">I think nothing, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.117">That's a fair thought to lie between maids'
> legs.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.118">What is, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech37">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.119">Nothing.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.120">You are merry, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.121">Who, I?</span>  

<span id="speech40">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.122">Ay, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.123">O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man

> <span id="3.2.124">but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully

> <span id="3.2.125">mother looks, and my father died within these two
> hours.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.126">Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.127">So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black,

> <span id="3.2.128">I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die

<span id="speech44">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.135">What means this, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech45">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.136">Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means

<span id="speech46">**OPHELIA**</span>

<span id="speech48">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.140">Will he tell us what this show meant?</span>  

<span id="speech49">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.141">Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not
> you</span>  
> <span id="3.2.142">ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what

<span id="speech50">**OPHELIA**</span>

<span id="speech52">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="3.2.147">Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?</span>  

<span id="speech53">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.148">'Tis brief, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech54">**HAMLET**</span>
