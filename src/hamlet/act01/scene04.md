## SCENE IV

### The platform.

> *Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS*

<span id="speech1">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.4.1">The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.2">It is a nipping and an eager air.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.4.3">What hour now?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.4">I think it lacks of twelve.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.4.5">No, it is struck.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.6">Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the
> season</span>  
> <span id="1.4.7">Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.</span>  
>
> *A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within*
>
> <span id="1.4.8">What does this mean, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.4.9">The king doth wake to-night and takes his
> rouse,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.10">Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring
> reels;</span>  
> <span id="1.4.11">And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish
> down,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.12">The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out</span>  
> <span id="1.4.13">The triumph of his pledge.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.14">Is it a custom?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.4.15">Ay, marry, is't:</span>  
> <span id="1.4.16">But to my mind, though I am native here</span>  
> <span id="1.4.17">And to the manner born, it is a custom</span>  
> <span id="1.4.18">More honour'd in the breach than the
> observance.</span>  
> <span id="1.4.19">This heavy-headed revel east and west</span>  
> <span id="1.4.20">Makes us traduced and tax'd of other
> nations:</span>  
> <span id="1.4.21">They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish
> phrase</span>  
> <span id="1.4.22">Soil our addition; and indeed it takes</span>  
> <span id="1.4.23">From our achievements, though perform'd at
> height,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.24">The pith and marrow of our attribute.</span>  
> <span id="1.4.25">So, oft it chances in particular men,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.26">That for some vicious mole of nature in
> them,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.27">As, in their birth--wherein they are not
> guilty,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.28">Since nature cannot choose his origin--</span>  
> <span id="1.4.29">By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.30">Oft breaking down the pales and forts of
> reason,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.31">Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens</span>  
> <span id="1.4.32">The form of plausive manners, that these
> men,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.33">Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.34">Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--</span>  
> <span id="1.4.35">Their virtues else--be they as pure as
> grace,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.36">As infinite as man may undergo--</span>  
> <span id="1.4.37">Shall in the general censure take
> corruption</span>  
> <span id="1.4.38">From that particular fault: the dram of
> eale</span>  
> <span id="1.4.39">Doth all the noble substance of a doubt</span>  
> <span id="1.4.40">To his own scandal.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.41">Look, my lord, it comes!</span>  
>
> *Enter Ghost*

<span id="speech11">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.4.42">Angels and ministers of grace defend us!</span>  
> <span id="1.4.43">Be thou a spirit of health or goblin
> damn'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.44">Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from
> hell,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.45">Be thy intents wicked or charitable,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.46">Thou comest in such a questionable shape</span>  
> <span id="1.4.47">That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee
> Hamlet,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.48">King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!</span>  
> <span id="1.4.49">Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell</span>  
> <span id="1.4.50">Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.51">Have burst their cerements; why the
> sepulchre,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.52">Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.53">Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.54">To cast thee up again. What may this mean,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.55">That thou, dead corse, again in complete
> steel</span>  
> <span id="1.4.56">Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.57">Making night hideous; and we fools of
> nature</span>  
> <span id="1.4.58">So horridly to shake our disposition</span>  
> <span id="1.4.59">With thoughts beyond the reaches of our
> souls?</span>  
> <span id="1.4.60">Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we
> do?</span>  
>
> *Ghost beckons HAMLET*

<span id="speech12">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.61">It beckons you to go away with it,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.62">As if it some impartment did desire</span>  
> <span id="1.4.63">To you alone.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.4.64">Look, with what courteous action</span>  
> <span id="1.4.65">It waves you to a more removed ground:</span>  
> <span id="1.4.66">But do not go with it.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.67">No, by no means.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.4.68">It will not speak; then I will follow it.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.69">Do not, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.4.70">Why, what should be the fear?</span>  
> <span id="1.4.71">I do not set my life in a pin's fee;</span>  
> <span id="1.4.72">And for my soul, what can it do to that,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.73">Being a thing immortal as itself?</span>  
> <span id="1.4.74">It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.75">What if it tempt you toward the flood, my
> lord,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.76">Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff</span>  
> <span id="1.4.77">That beetles o'er his base into the sea,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.78">And there assume some other horrible form,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.79">Which might deprive your sovereignty of
> reason</span>  
> <span id="1.4.80">And draw you into madness? think of it:</span>  
> <span id="1.4.81">The very place puts toys of desperation,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.82">Without more motive, into every brain</span>  
> <span id="1.4.83">That looks so many fathoms to the sea</span>  
> <span id="1.4.84">And hears it roar beneath.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.4.85">It waves me still.</span>  
> <span id="1.4.86">Go on; I'll follow thee.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.4.87">You shall not go, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.4.88">Hold off your hands.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.89">Be ruled; you shall not go.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.4.90">My fate cries out,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.91">And makes each petty artery in this body</span>  
> <span id="1.4.92">As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.</span>  
> <span id="1.4.93">Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.</span>  
> <span id="1.4.94">By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets
> me!</span>  
> <span id="1.4.95">I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET*

<span id="speech24">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.96">He waxes desperate with imagination.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.4.97">Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey
> him.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.98">Have after. To what issue will this come?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.4.99">Something is rotten in the state of
> Denmark.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.100">Heaven will direct it.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.4.101">Nay, let's follow him.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
