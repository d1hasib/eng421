## SCENE II

### A room of state in the castle.

> *Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES,
> VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants*

<span id="speech1">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.1">Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's
> death</span>  
> <span id="1.2.2">The memory be green, and that it us befitted</span>  
> <span id="1.2.3">To bear our hearts in grief and our whole
> kingdom</span>  
> <span id="1.2.4">To be contracted in one brow of woe,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.5">Yet so far hath discretion fought with
> nature</span>  
> <span id="1.2.6">That we with wisest sorrow think on him,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.7">Together with remembrance of ourselves.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.8">Therefore our sometime sister, now our
> queen,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.9">The imperial jointress to this warlike
> state,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.10">Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.11">With an auspicious and a dropping eye,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.12">With mirth in funeral and with dirge in
> marriage,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.13">In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.14">Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd</span>  
> <span id="1.2.15">Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</span>  
> <span id="1.2.16">With this affair along. For all, our
> thanks.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.17">Now follows, that you know, young
> Fortinbras,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.18">Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.19">Or thinking by our late dear brother's
> death</span>  
> <span id="1.2.20">Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.21">Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.22">He hath not fail'd to pester us with
> message,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.23">Importing the surrender of those lands</span>  
> <span id="1.2.24">Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.25">To our most valiant brother. So much for
> him.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.26">Now for ourself and for this time of
> meeting:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.27">Thus much the business is: we have here
> writ</span>  
> <span id="1.2.28">To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.29">Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears</span>  
> <span id="1.2.30">Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress</span>  
> <span id="1.2.31">His further gait herein; in that the
> levies,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.32">The lists and full proportions, are all
> made</span>  
> <span id="1.2.33">Out of his subject: and we here dispatch</span>  
> <span id="1.2.34">You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.35">For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.36">Giving to you no further personal power</span>  
> <span id="1.2.37">To business with the king, more than the
> scope</span>  
> <span id="1.2.38">Of these delated articles allow.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.39">Farewell, and let your haste commend your
> duty.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**CORNELIUS**</span> <span
id="speech3">**VOLTIMAND**</span>

> <span id="1.2.40">In that and all things will we show our
> duty.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.41">We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS*
>
> <span id="1.2.42">And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.43">You told us of some suit; what is't,
> Laertes?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.44">You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.45">And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg,
> Laertes,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.46">That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.47">The head is not more native to the heart,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.48">The hand more instrumental to the mouth,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.49">Than is the throne of Denmark to thy
> father.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.50">What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="1.2.51">My dread lord,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.52">Your leave and favour to return to France;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.53">From whence though willingly I came to
> Denmark,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.54">To show my duty in your coronation,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.55">Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.56">My thoughts and wishes bend again toward
> France</span>  
> <span id="1.2.57">And bow them to your gracious leave and
> pardon.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.58">Have you your father's leave? What says
> Polonius?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.59">He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow
> leave</span>  
> <span id="1.2.60">By laboursome petition, and at last</span>  
> <span id="1.2.61">Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.62">I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.63">Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.64">And thy best graces spend it at thy will!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.65">But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--</span>  

<span id="speech9">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.66">\[Aside\] A little more than kin, and less than
> kind.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.67">How is it that the clouds still hang on
> you?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.68">Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.69">Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.70">And let thine eye look like a friend on
> Denmark.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.71">Do not for ever with thy vailed lids</span>  
> <span id="1.2.72">Seek for thy noble father in the dust:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.73">Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must
> die,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.74">Passing through nature to eternity.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.75">Ay, madam, it is common.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.76">If it be,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.77">Why seems it so particular with thee?</span>  

<span id="speech15">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.78">Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not
> 'seems.'</span>  
> <span id="1.2.79">'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.80">Nor customary suits of solemn black,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.81">Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.82">No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.83">Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.84">Together with all forms, moods, shapes of
> grief,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.85">That can denote me truly: these indeed
> seem,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.86">For they are actions that a man might play:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.87">But I have that within which passeth show;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.88">These but the trappings and the suits of
> woe.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.89">'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature,
> Hamlet,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.90">To give these mourning duties to your
> father:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.91">But, you must know, your father lost a
> father;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.92">That father lost, lost his, and the survivor
> bound</span>  
> <span id="1.2.93">In filial obligation for some term</span>  
> <span id="1.2.94">To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever</span>  
> <span id="1.2.95">In obstinate condolement is a course</span>  
> <span id="1.2.96">Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly
> grief;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.97">It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.98">A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.99">An understanding simple and unschool'd:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.100">For what we know must be and is as common</span>  
> <span id="1.2.101">As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.102">Why should we in our peevish opposition</span>  
> <span id="1.2.103">Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to
> heaven,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.104">A fault against the dead, a fault to
> nature,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.105">To reason most absurd: whose common theme</span>  
> <span id="1.2.106">Is death of fathers, and who still hath
> cried,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.107">From the first corse till he that died
> to-day,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.108">'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to
> earth</span>  
> <span id="1.2.109">This unprevailing woe, and think of us</span>  
> <span id="1.2.110">As of a father: for let the world take
> note,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.111">You are the most immediate to our throne;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.112">And with no less nobility of love</span>  
> <span id="1.2.113">Than that which dearest father bears his
> son,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.114">Do I impart toward you. For your intent</span>  
> <span id="1.2.115">In going back to school in Wittenberg,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.116">It is most retrograde to our desire:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.117">And we beseech you, bend you to remain</span>  
> <span id="1.2.118">Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.119">Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our
> son.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.120">Let not thy mother lose her prayers,
> Hamlet:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.121">I pray thee, stay with us; go not to
> Wittenberg.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.122">I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.123">Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.124">Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.125">This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet</span>  
> <span id="1.2.126">Sits smiling to my heart: in grace
> whereof,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.127">No jocund health that Denmark drinks
> to-day,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.128">But the great cannon to the clouds shall
> tell,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.129">And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit
> again,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.130">Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt all but HAMLET*

<span id="speech20">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.131">O, that this too too solid flesh would
> melt</span>  
> <span id="1.2.132">Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.133">Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd</span>  
> <span id="1.2.134">His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God!
> God!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.135">How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.136">Seem to me all the uses of this world!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.137">Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.138">That grows to seed; things rank and gross in
> nature</span>  
> <span id="1.2.139">Possess it merely. That it should come to
> this!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.140">But two months dead: nay, not so much, not
> two:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.141">So excellent a king; that was, to this,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.142">Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my
> mother</span>  
> <span id="1.2.143">That he might not beteem the winds of
> heaven</span>  
> <span id="1.2.144">Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and
> earth!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.145">Must I remember? why, she would hang on
> him,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.146">As if increase of appetite had grown</span>  
> <span id="1.2.147">By what it fed on: and yet, within a
> month--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.148">Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is
> woman!--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.149">A little month, or ere those shoes were
> old</span>  
> <span id="1.2.150">With which she follow'd my poor father's
> body,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.151">Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even
> she--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.152">O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of
> reason,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.153">Would have mourn'd longer--married with my
> uncle,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.154">My father's brother, but no more like my
> father</span>  
> <span id="1.2.155">Than I to Hercules: within a month:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.156">Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears</span>  
> <span id="1.2.157">Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.158">She married. O, most wicked speed, to post</span>  
> <span id="1.2.159">With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.160">It is not nor it cannot come to good:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.161">But break, my heart; for I must hold my
> tongue.</span>  
>
> *Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO*

<span id="speech21">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.162">Hail to your lordship!</span>  

<span id="speech22">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.163">I am glad to see you well:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.164">Horatio,--or I do forget myself.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.165">The same, my lord, and your poor servant
> ever.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.166">Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with
> you:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.167">And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
> Marcellus?</span>  

<span id="speech25">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.168">My good lord--</span>  

<span id="speech26">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.169">I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.170">But what, in faith, make you from
> Wittenberg?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.171">A truant disposition, good my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.172">I would not hear your enemy say so,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.173">Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.174">To make it truster of your own report</span>  
> <span id="1.2.175">Against yourself: I know you are no
> truant.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.176">But what is your affair in Elsinore?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.177">We'll teach you to drink deep ere you
> depart.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.178">My lord, I came to see your father's
> funeral.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.179">I pray thee, do not mock me,
> fellow-student;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.180">I think it was to see my mother's wedding.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.181">Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.182">Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked
> meats</span>  
> <span id="1.2.183">Did coldly furnish forth the marriage
> tables.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.184">Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven</span>  
> <span id="1.2.185">Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.186">My father!--methinks I see my father.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.187">Where, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech34">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.188">In my mind's eye, Horatio.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.189">I saw him once; he was a goodly king.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.190">He was a man, take him for all in all,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.191">I shall not look upon his like again.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.192">My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.193">Saw? who?</span>  

<span id="speech39">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.194">My lord, the king your father.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.195">The king my father!</span>  

<span id="speech41">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.196">Season your admiration for awhile</span>  
> <span id="1.2.197">With an attent ear, till I may deliver,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.198">Upon the witness of these gentlemen,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.199">This marvel to you.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.200">For God's love, let me hear.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.201">Two nights together had these gentlemen,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.202">Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.203">In the dead vast and middle of the night,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.204">Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your
> father,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.205">Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.206">Appears before them, and with solemn march</span>  
> <span id="1.2.207">Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he
> walk'd</span>  
> <span id="1.2.208">By their oppress'd and fear-surprised
> eyes,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.209">Within his truncheon's length; whilst they,
> distilled</span>  
> <span id="1.2.210">Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.211">Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to
> me</span>  
> <span id="1.2.212">In dreadful secrecy impart they did;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.213">And I with them the third night kept the
> watch;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.214">Where, as they had deliver'd, both in
> time,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.215">Form of the thing, each word made true and
> good,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.216">The apparition comes: I knew your father;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.217">These hands are not more like.</span>  

<span id="speech44">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.218">But where was this?</span>  

<span id="speech45">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.219">My lord, upon the platform where we
> watch'd.</span>  

<span id="speech46">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.220">Did you not speak to it?</span>  

<span id="speech47">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.221">My lord, I did;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.222">But answer made it none: yet once
> methought</span>  
> <span id="1.2.223">It lifted up its head and did address</span>  
> <span id="1.2.224">Itself to motion, like as it would speak;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.225">But even then the morning cock crew loud,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.226">And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.227">And vanish'd from our sight.</span>  

<span id="speech48">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.228">'Tis very strange.</span>  

<span id="speech49">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.229">As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.230">And we did think it writ down in our duty</span>  
> <span id="1.2.231">To let you know of it.</span>  

<span id="speech50">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.232">Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles
> me.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.233">Hold you the watch to-night?</span>  

<span id="speech51">**MARCELLUS**</span> <span
id="speech52">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.234">We do, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech53">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.2.235">Arm'd, say you?</span>  

<span id="speech54">**MARCELLUS**</span> <span
id="speech55">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.236">Arm'd, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech56">**HAMLET**</span>
