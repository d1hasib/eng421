## SCENE I

### Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

> *FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO*

<span id="speech1">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.1">Who's there?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**FRANCISCO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.2">Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.3">Long live the king!</span>  

<span id="speech4">**FRANCISCO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.4">Bernardo?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.5">He.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**FRANCISCO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.6">You come most carefully upon your hour.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.7">'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed,
> Francisco.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**FRANCISCO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.8">For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter
> cold,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.9">And I am sick at heart.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.10">Have you had quiet guard?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**FRANCISCO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.11">Not a mouse stirring.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.12">Well, good night.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.13">If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.14">The rivals of my watch, bid them make
> haste.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**FRANCISCO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.15">I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's
> there?</span>  
>
> *Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS*

<span id="speech13">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.16">Friends to this ground.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.17">And liegemen to the Dane.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**FRANCISCO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.18">Give you good night.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.19">O, farewell, honest soldier:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.20">Who hath relieved you?</span>  

<span id="speech17">**FRANCISCO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.21">Bernardo has my place.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.22">Give you good night.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech18">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.23">Holla! Bernardo!</span>  

<span id="speech19">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.24">Say,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.25">What, is Horatio there?</span>  

<span id="speech20">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.26">A piece of him.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.27">Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.28">What, has this thing appear'd again
> to-night?</span>  

<span id="speech23">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.29">I have seen nothing.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.30">Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.31">And will not let belief take hold of him</span>  
> <span id="1.1.32">Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of
> us:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.33">Therefore I have entreated him along</span>  
> <span id="1.1.34">With us to watch the minutes of this night;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.35">That if again this apparition come,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.36">He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.37">Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.38">Sit down awhile;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.39">And let us once again assail your ears,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.40">That are so fortified against our story</span>  
> <span id="1.1.41">What we have two nights seen.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.42">Well, sit we down,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.43">And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.44">Last night of all,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.45">When yond same star that's westward from the
> pole</span>  
> <span id="1.1.46">Had made his course to illume that part of
> heaven</span>  
> <span id="1.1.47">Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.48">The bell then beating one,--</span>  
>
> *Enter Ghost*

<span id="speech29">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.49">Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes
> again!</span>  

<span id="speech30">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.50">In the same figure, like the king that's
> dead.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.51">Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.52">Looks it not like the king? mark it,
> Horatio.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.53">Most like: it harrows me with fear and
> wonder.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.54">It would be spoke to.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.55">Question it, Horatio.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.56">What art thou that usurp'st this time of
> night,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.57">Together with that fair and warlike form</span>  
> <span id="1.1.58">In which the majesty of buried Denmark</span>  
> <span id="1.1.59">Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee,
> speak!</span>  

<span id="speech37">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.60">It is offended.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.61">See, it stalks away!</span>  

<span id="speech39">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.62">Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!</span>  
>
> *Exit Ghost*

<span id="speech40">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.63">'Tis gone, and will not answer.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.64">How now, Horatio! you tremble and look
> pale:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.65">Is not this something more than fantasy?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.66">What think you on't?</span>  

<span id="speech42">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.67">Before my God, I might not this believe</span>  
> <span id="1.1.68">Without the sensible and true avouch</span>  
> <span id="1.1.69">Of mine own eyes.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.70">Is it not like the king?</span>  

<span id="speech44">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.71">As thou art to thyself:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.72">Such was the very armour he had on</span>  
> <span id="1.1.73">When he the ambitious Norway combated;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.74">So frown'd he once, when, in an angry
> parle,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.75">He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.76">'Tis strange.</span>  

<span id="speech45">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.77">Thus twice before, and jump at this dead
> hour,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.78">With martial stalk hath he gone by our
> watch.</span>  

<span id="speech46">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.79">In what particular thought to work I know
> not;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.80">But in the gross and scope of my opinion,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.81">This bodes some strange eruption to our
> state.</span>  

<span id="speech47">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.82">Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that
> knows,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.83">Why this same strict and most observant
> watch</span>  
> <span id="1.1.84">So nightly toils the subject of the land,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.85">And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.86">And foreign mart for implements of war;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.87">Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore
> task</span>  
> <span id="1.1.88">Does not divide the Sunday from the week;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.89">What might be toward, that this sweaty
> haste</span>  
> <span id="1.1.90">Doth make the night joint-labourer with the
> day:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.91">Who is't that can inform me?</span>  

<span id="speech48">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.92">That can I;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.93">At least, the whisper goes so. Our last
> king,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.94">Whose image even but now appear'd to us,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.95">Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.96">Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.97">Dared to the combat; in which our valiant
> Hamlet--</span>  
> <span id="1.1.98">For so this side of our known world esteem'd
> him--</span>  
> <span id="1.1.99">Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd
> compact,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.100">Well ratified by law and heraldry,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.101">Did forfeit, with his life, all those his
> lands</span>  
> <span id="1.1.102">Which he stood seized of, to the
> conqueror:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.103">Against the which, a moiety competent</span>  
> <span id="1.1.104">Was gaged by our king; which had return'd</span>  
> <span id="1.1.105">To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.106">Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same
> covenant,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.107">And carriage of the article design'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.108">His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young
> Fortinbras,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.109">Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.110">Hath in the skirts of Norway here and
> there</span>  
> <span id="1.1.111">Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.112">For food and diet, to some enterprise</span>  
> <span id="1.1.113">That hath a stomach in't; which is no
> other--</span>  
> <span id="1.1.114">As it doth well appear unto our state--</span>  
> <span id="1.1.115">But to recover of us, by strong hand</span>  
> <span id="1.1.116">And terms compulsatory, those foresaid
> lands</span>  
> <span id="1.1.117">So by his father lost: and this, I take
> it,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.118">Is the main motive of our preparations,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.119">The source of this our watch and the chief
> head</span>  
> <span id="1.1.120">Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</span>  

<span id="speech49">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.121">I think it be no other but e'en so:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.122">Well may it sort that this portentous
> figure</span>  
> <span id="1.1.123">Comes armed through our watch; so like the
> king</span>  
> <span id="1.1.124">That was and is the question of these
> wars.</span>  

<span id="speech50">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.125">A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.126">In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.127">A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.128">The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted
> dead</span>  
> <span id="1.1.129">Did squeak and gibber in the Roman
> streets:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.130">As stars with trains of fire and dews of
> blood,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.131">Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</span>  
> <span id="1.1.132">Upon whose influence Neptune's empire
> stands</span>  
> <span id="1.1.133">Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.134">And even the like precurse of fierce
> events,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.135">As harbingers preceding still the fates</span>  
> <span id="1.1.136">And prologue to the omen coming on,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.137">Have heaven and earth together
> demonstrated</span>  
> <span id="1.1.138">Unto our climatures and countrymen.--</span>  
> <span id="1.1.139">But soft, behold! lo, where it comes
> again!</span>  
>
> *Re-enter Ghost*
>
> <span id="1.1.140">I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay,
> illusion!</span>  
> <span id="1.1.141">If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.142">Speak to me:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.143">If there be any good thing to be done,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.144">That may to thee do ease and grace to me,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.145">Speak to me:</span>  
>
> *Cock crows*
>
> <span id="1.1.146">If thou art privy to thy country's fate,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.147">Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O,
> speak!</span>  
> <span id="1.1.148">Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</span>  
> <span id="1.1.149">Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.150">For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in
> death,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.151">Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it,
> Marcellus.</span>  

<span id="speech51">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.152">Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</span>  

<span id="speech52">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.153">Do, if it will not stand.</span>  

<span id="speech53">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.154">'Tis here!</span>  

<span id="speech54">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.155">'Tis here!</span>  

<span id="speech55">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.156">'Tis gone!</span>  
>
> *Exit Ghost*
>
> <span id="1.1.157">We do it wrong, being so majestical,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.158">To offer it the show of violence;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.159">For it is, as the air, invulnerable,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.160">And our vain blows malicious mockery.</span>  

<span id="speech56">**BERNARDO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.161">It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</span>  

<span id="speech57">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.162">And then it started like a guilty thing</span>  
> <span id="1.1.163">Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.164">The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.165">Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding
> throat</span>  
> <span id="1.1.166">Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.167">Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.168">The extravagant and erring spirit hies</span>  
> <span id="1.1.169">To his confine: and of the truth herein</span>  
> <span id="1.1.170">This present object made probation.</span>  

<span id="speech58">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.171">It faded on the crowing of the cock.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.172">Some say that ever 'gainst that season
> comes</span>  
> <span id="1.1.173">Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.174">The bird of dawning singeth all night
> long:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.175">And then, they say, no spirit dares stir
> abroad;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.176">The nights are wholesome; then no planets
> strike,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.177">No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to
> charm,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.178">So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.</span>  

<span id="speech59">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.179">So have I heard and do in part believe it.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.180">But, look, the morn, in russet mantle
> clad,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.181">Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward

> <span id="1.1.182">Break we our watch up; and by my advice,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.183">Let us impart what we have seen to-night</span>  
> <span id="1.1.184">Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.185">This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to

> <span id="1.1.186">Do you consent we shall acquaint him with

> <span id="1.1.187">As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</span>  

<span id="speech60">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.188">Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning

> <span id="1.1.189">Where we shall find him most conveniently.</span>
