> *Enter GHOST and HAMLET*

<span id="speech1">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.1">Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no
> further.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Ghost**</span>

> <span id="1.5.2">Mark me.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.3">I will.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Ghost**</span>

> <span id="1.5.4">My hour is almost come,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.5">When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames</span>  
> <span id="1.5.6">Must render up myself.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.7">Alas, poor ghost!</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Ghost**</span>

> <span id="1.5.8">Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing</span>  
> <span id="1.5.9">To what I shall unfold.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.10">Speak; I am bound to hear.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**Ghost**</span>

> <span id="1.5.11">So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt
> hear.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.12">What?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**Ghost**</span>

> <span id="1.5.13">I am thy father's spirit,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.14">Doom'd for a certain term to walk the
> night,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.15">And for the day confined to fast in fires,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.16">Till the foul crimes done in my days of
> nature</span>  
> <span id="1.5.17">Are burnt and purged away. But that I am
> forbid</span>  
> <span id="1.5.18">To tell the secrets of my prison-house,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.19">I could a tale unfold whose lightest word</span>  
> <span id="1.5.20">Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young
> blood,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.21">Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their
> spheres,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.22">Thy knotted and combined locks to part</span>  
> <span id="1.5.23">And each particular hair to stand on end,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.24">Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:</span>  
> <span id="1.5.25">But this eternal blazon must not be</span>  
> <span id="1.5.26">To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O,
> list!</span>  
> <span id="1.5.27">If thou didst ever thy dear father love--</span>  

<span id="speech11">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.28">O God!</span>  

<span id="speech12">**Ghost**</span>

> <span id="1.5.29">Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.30">Murder!</span>  

<span id="speech14">**Ghost**</span>

> <span id="1.5.31">Murder most foul, as in the best it is;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.32">But this most foul, strange and unnatural.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.33">Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as
> swift</span>  
> <span id="1.5.34">As meditation or the thoughts of love,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.35">May sweep to my revenge.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**Ghost**</span>

> <span id="1.5.36">I find thee apt;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.37">And duller shouldst thou be than the fat
> weed</span>  
> <span id="1.5.38">That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.39">Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet,
> hear:</span>  
> <span id="1.5.40">'Tis given out that, sleeping in my
> orchard,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.41">A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of
> Denmark</span>  
> <span id="1.5.42">Is by a forged process of my death</span>  
> <span id="1.5.43">Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.44">The serpent that did sting thy father's
> life</span>  
> <span id="1.5.45">Now wears his crown.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.46">O my prophetic soul! My uncle!</span>  

<span id="speech18">**Ghost**</span>

> <span id="1.5.47">Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.48">With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous
> gifts,--</span>  
> <span id="1.5.49">O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power</span>  
> <span id="1.5.50">So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust</span>  
> <span id="1.5.51">The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:</span>  
> <span id="1.5.52">O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!</span>  
> <span id="1.5.53">From me, whose love was of that dignity</span>  
> <span id="1.5.54">That it went hand in hand even with the vow</span>  
> <span id="1.5.55">I made to her in marriage, and to decline</span>  
> <span id="1.5.56">Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor</span>  
> <span id="1.5.57">To those of mine!</span>  
> <span id="1.5.58">But virtue, as it never will be moved,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.59">Though lewdness court it in a shape of
> heaven,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.60">So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.61">Will sate itself in a celestial bed,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.62">And prey on garbage.</span>  
> <span id="1.5.63">But, soft! methinks I scent the morning
> air;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.64">Brief let me be. Sleeping within my
> orchard,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.65">My custom always of the afternoon,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.66">Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.67">With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.68">And in the porches of my ears did pour</span>  
> <span id="1.5.69">The leperous distilment; whose effect</span>  
> <span id="1.5.70">Holds such an enmity with blood of man</span>  
> <span id="1.5.71">That swift as quicksilver it courses
> through</span>  
> <span id="1.5.72">The natural gates and alleys of the body,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.73">And with a sudden vigour doth posset</span>  
> <span id="1.5.74">And curd, like eager droppings into milk,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.75">The thin and wholesome blood: so did it
> mine;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.76">And a most instant tetter bark'd about,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.77">Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome
> crust,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.78">All my smooth body.</span>  
> <span id="1.5.79">Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand</span>  
> <span id="1.5.80">Of life, of crown, of queen, at once
> dispatch'd:</span>  
> <span id="1.5.81">Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.82">Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.83">No reckoning made, but sent to my account</span>  
> <span id="1.5.84">With all my imperfections on my head:</span>  
> <span id="1.5.85">O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!</span>  
> <span id="1.5.86">If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.87">Let not the royal bed of Denmark be</span>  
> <span id="1.5.88">A couch for luxury and damned incest.</span>  
> <span id="1.5.89">But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.90">Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul
> contrive</span>  
> <span id="1.5.91">Against thy mother aught: leave her to
> heaven</span>  
> <span id="1.5.92">And to those thorns that in her bosom
> lodge,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.93">To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at
> once!</span>  
> <span id="1.5.94">The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.95">And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:</span>  
> <span id="1.5.96">Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech19">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.97">O all you host of heaven! O earth! what
> else?</span>  
> <span id="1.5.98">And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my
> heart;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.99">And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.100">But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!</span>  
> <span id="1.5.101">Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a
> seat</span>  
> <span id="1.5.102">In this distracted globe. Remember thee!</span>  
> <span id="1.5.103">Yea, from the table of my memory</span>  
> <span id="1.5.104">I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.105">All saws of books, all forms, all pressures

> <span id="1.5.106">That youth and observation copied there;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.107">And thy commandment all alone shall live</span>  
> <span id="1.5.108">Within the book and volume of my brain,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.109">Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!</span>  
> <span id="1.5.110">O most pernicious woman!</span>  
> <span id="1.5.111">O villain, villain, smiling, damned

> <span id="1.5.112">My tables,--meet it is I set it down,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.113">That one may smile, and smile, and be a

> <span id="1.5.114">At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:</span>

>
> <span id="1.5.115">So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.116">It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'</span>  
> <span id="1.5.117">I have sworn 't.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**MARCELLUS**</span> <span
id="speech21">**HORATIO**</span>

<span id="speech23">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.5.120">\[Within\] Heaven secure him!</span>  

<span id="speech24">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.121">So be it!</span>  

<span id="speech25">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.5.122">\[Within\] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!</span>  

<span id="speech26">**HAMLET**</span>

>
> *Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS*

<span id="speech27">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.5.124">How is't, my noble lord?</span>  

<span id="speech28">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.5.125">What news, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech29">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.126">O, wonderful!</span>  

<span id="speech30">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.5.127">Good my lord, tell it.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.128">No; you'll reveal it.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.5.129">Not I, my lord, by heaven.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.5.130">Nor I, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.131">How say you, then; would heart of man once think
> it?</span>  
> <span id="1.5.132">But you'll be secret?</span>  

<span id="speech35">**HORATIO**</span> <span
id="speech36">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.5.133">Ay, by heaven, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.134">There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all
> Denmark</span>  
> <span id="1.5.135">But he's an arrant knave.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.5.136">There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the

> <span id="1.5.137">To tell us this.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.138">Why, right; you are i' the right;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.139">And so, without more circumstance at all,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.140">I hold it fit that we shake hands and

> <span id="1.5.141">You, as your business and desire shall point

> <span id="1.5.142">For every man has business and desire,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.143">Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.144">Look you, I'll go pray.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.5.145">These are but wild and whirling words, my

<span id="speech41">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.146">I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.147">Yes, 'faith heartily.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.5.148">There's no offence, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.149">Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is,

> <span id="1.5.150">And much offence too. Touching this vision

> <span id="1.5.151">It is an honest ghost, that let me tell

> <span id="1.5.152">For your desire to know what is between

> <span id="1.5.153">O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good

> <span id="1.5.154">As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.155">Give me one poor request.</span>  

<span id="speech44">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.5.156">What is't, my lord? we will.</span>  

<span id="speech45">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.157">Never make known what you have seen

<span id="speech46">**HORATIO**</span> <span
id="speech47">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.5.158">My lord, we will not.</span>  

<span id="speech48">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.159">Nay, but swear't.</span>  

<span id="speech49">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.5.160">In faith,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.161">My lord, not I.</span>  

<span id="speech50">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.5.162">Nor I, my lord, in faith.</span>  

<span id="speech51">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.163">Upon my sword.</span>  

<span id="speech52">**MARCELLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.5.164">We have sworn, my lord, already.</span>  

<span id="speech53">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.165">Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.</span>  

<span id="speech54">**Ghost**</span>

> <span id="1.5.166">\[Beneath\] Swear.</span>  

<span id="speech55">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.167">Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou

> <span id="1.5.169">Come on--you hear this fellow in the

> <span id="1.5.170">Consent to swear.</span>  

<span id="speech56">**HORATIO**</span>

> <span id="1.5.171">Propose the oath, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech57">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.172">Never to speak of this that you have seen,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.173">Swear by my sword.</span>  

<span id="speech58">**Ghost**</span>

> <span id="1.5.174">\[Beneath\] Swear.</span>  

<span id="speech59">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="1.5.175">Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our

> <span id="1.5.176">Come hither, gentlemen,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.177">And lay your hands again upon my sword:</span>

<span id="speech62">**HORATIO**</span>

<span id="speech63">**HAMLET**</span>
