## SCENE III

### A room in Polonius' house.

> *Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA*

<span id="speech1">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="1.3.1">My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.2">And, sister, as the winds give benefit</span>  
> <span id="1.3.3">And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.4">But let me hear from you.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.5">Do you doubt that?</span>  

<span id="speech3">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="1.3.6">For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.7">Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.8">A violet in the youth of primy nature,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.9">Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.10">The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No
> more.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.11">No more but so?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="1.3.12">Think it no more;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.13">For nature, crescent, does not grow alone</span>  
> <span id="1.3.14">In thews and bulk, but, as this temple
> waxes,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.15">The inward service of the mind and soul</span>  
> <span id="1.3.16">Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you
> now,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.17">And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</span>  
> <span id="1.3.18">The virtue of his will: but you must fear,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.19">His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his
> own;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.20">For he himself is subject to his birth:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.21">He may not, as unvalued persons do,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.22">Carve for himself; for on his choice
> depends</span>  
> <span id="1.3.23">The safety and health of this whole state;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.24">And therefore must his choice be
> circumscribed</span>  
> <span id="1.3.25">Unto the voice and yielding of that body</span>  
> <span id="1.3.26">Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves
> you,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.27">It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</span>  
> <span id="1.3.28">As he in his particular act and place</span>  
> <span id="1.3.29">May give his saying deed; which is no
> further</span>  
> <span id="1.3.30">Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.31">Then weigh what loss your honour may
> sustain,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.32">If with too credent ear you list his songs,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.33">Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure
> open</span>  
> <span id="1.3.34">To his unmaster'd importunity.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.35">Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.36">And keep you in the rear of your affection,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.37">Out of the shot and danger of desire.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.38">The chariest maid is prodigal enough,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.39">If she unmask her beauty to the moon:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.40">Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious
> strokes:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.41">The canker galls the infants of the spring,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.42">Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.43">And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</span>  
> <span id="1.3.44">Contagious blastments are most imminent.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.45">Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.46">Youth to itself rebels, though none else
> near.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.47">I shall the effect of this good lesson
> keep,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.48">As watchman to my heart. But, good my
> brother,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.49">Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.50">Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.51">Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless
> libertine,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.52">Himself the primrose path of dalliance
> treads,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.53">And recks not his own rede.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="1.3.54">O, fear me not.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.55">I stay too long: but here my father comes.</span>  
>
> *Enter POLONIUS*
>
> <span id="1.3.56">A double blessing is a double grace,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.57">Occasion smiles upon a second leave.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.58">Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for
> shame!</span>  
> <span id="1.3.59">The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.60">And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with
> thee!</span>  
> <span id="1.3.61">And these few precepts in thy memory</span>  
> <span id="1.3.62">See thou character. Give thy thoughts no
> tongue,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.63">Nor any unproportioned thought his act.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.64">Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.65">Those friends thou hast, and their adoption
> tried,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.66">Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of
> steel;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.67">But do not dull thy palm with entertainment</span>  
> <span id="1.3.68">Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade.
> Beware</span>  
> <span id="1.3.69">Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.70">Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.71">Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.72">Take each man's censure, but reserve thy
> judgment.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.73">Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.74">But not express'd in fancy; rich, not
> gaudy;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.75">For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.76">And they in France of the best rank and
> station</span>  
> <span id="1.3.77">Are of a most select and generous chief in
> that.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.78">Neither a borrower nor a lender be;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.79">For loan oft loses both itself and friend,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.80">And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.81">This above all: to thine ownself be true,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.82">And it must follow, as the night the day,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.83">Thou canst not then be false to any man.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.84">Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!</span>  

<span id="speech9">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="1.3.85">Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.86">The time invites you; go; your servants
> tend.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="1.3.87">Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well</span>  
> <span id="1.3.88">What I have said to you.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.89">'Tis in my memory lock'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.90">And you yourself shall keep the key of it.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**LAERTES**</span>

> <span id="1.3.91">Farewell.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech14">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.92">What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?</span>  

<span id="speech15">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.93">So please you, something touching the Lord
> Hamlet.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.94">Marry, well bethought:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.95">'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late</span>  
> <span id="1.3.96">Given private time to you; and you yourself</span>  
> <span id="1.3.97">Have of your audience been most free and
> bounteous:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.98">If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.99">And that in way of caution, I must tell
> you,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.100">You do not understand yourself so clearly</span>  
> <span id="1.3.101">As it behoves my daughter and your honour.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.102">What is between you? give me up the truth.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.103">He hath, my lord, of late made many
> tenders</span>  
> <span id="1.3.104">Of his affection to me.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.105">Affection! pooh! you speak like a green
> girl,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.106">Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.107">Do you believe his tenders, as you call
> them?</span>  

<span id="speech19">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.108">I do not know, my lord, what I should
> think.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.109">Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a
> baby;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.110">That you have ta'en these tenders for true
> pay,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.111">Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more
> dearly;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.112">Or--not to crack the wind of the poor
> phrase,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.113">Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.114">My lord, he hath importuned me with love</span>  
> <span id="1.3.115">In honourable fashion.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.116">Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.117">And hath given countenance to his speech, my
> lord,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.118">With almost all the holy vows of heaven.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.119">Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do
> know,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.120">When the blood burns, how prodigal the
> soul</span>  
> <span id="1.3.121">Lends the tongue vows: these blazes,
> daughter,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.122">Giving more light than heat, extinct in
> both,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.123">Even in their promise, as it is a-making,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.124">You must not take for fire. From this time</span>  
> <span id="1.3.125">Be somewhat scanter of your maiden
> presence;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.126">Set your entreatments at a higher rate</span>  
> <span id="1.3.127">Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.128">Believe so much in him, that he is young</span>  
> <span id="1.3.129">And with a larger tether may he walk</span>  
> <span id="1.3.130">Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.131">Do not believe his vows; for they are
> brokers,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.132">Not of that dye which their investments
> show,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.133">But mere implorators of unholy suits,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.134">Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.135">The better to beguile. This is for all:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.136">I would not, in plain terms, from this time
> forth,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.137">Have you so slander any moment leisure,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.138">As to give words or talk with the Lord
> Hamlet.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.139">Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.140">I shall obey, my lord.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
