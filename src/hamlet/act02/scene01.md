## SCENE I

### A room in POLONIUS' house.

> *Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO*

<span id="speech1">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.1">Give him this money and these notes,
> Reynaldo.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**REYNALDO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.2">I will, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.3">You shall do marvellous wisely, good
> Reynaldo,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.4">Before you visit him, to make inquire</span>  
> <span id="2.1.5">Of his behavior.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**REYNALDO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.6">My lord, I did intend it.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.7">Marry, well said; very well said. Look you,
> sir,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.8">Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.9">And how, and who, what means, and where they
> keep,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.10">What company, at what expense; and finding</span>  
> <span id="2.1.11">By this encompassment and drift of question</span>  
> <span id="2.1.12">That they do know my son, come you more
> nearer</span>  
> <span id="2.1.13">Than your particular demands will touch it:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.14">Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of
> him;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.15">As thus, 'I know his father and his
> friends,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.16">And in part him: ' do you mark this,
> Reynaldo?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**REYNALDO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.17">Ay, very well, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.18">'And in part him; but' you may say 'not
> well:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.19">But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.20">Addicted so and so:' and there put on him</span>  
> <span id="2.1.21">What forgeries you please; marry, none so
> rank</span>  
> <span id="2.1.22">As may dishonour him; take heed of that;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.23">But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips</span>  
> <span id="2.1.24">As are companions noted and most known</span>  
> <span id="2.1.25">To youth and liberty.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**REYNALDO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.26">As gaming, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.27">Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing,
> quarrelling,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.28">Drabbing: you may go so far.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**REYNALDO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.29">My lord, that would dishonour him.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.30">'Faith, no; as you may season it in the
> charge</span>  
> <span id="2.1.31">You must not put another scandal on him,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.32">That he is open to incontinency;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.33">That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so
> quaintly</span>  
> <span id="2.1.34">That they may seem the taints of liberty,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.35">The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.36">A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.37">Of general assault.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**REYNALDO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.38">But, my good lord,--</span>  

<span id="speech13">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.39">Wherefore should you do this?</span>  

<span id="speech14">**REYNALDO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.40">Ay, my lord,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.41">I would know that.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.42">Marry, sir, here's my drift;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.43">And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.44">You laying these slight sullies on my son,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.45">As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,
> Mark you,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.46">Your party in converse, him you would
> sound,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.47">Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</span>  
> <span id="2.1.48">The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</span>  
> <span id="2.1.49">He closes with you in this consequence;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.50">'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or
> 'gentleman,'</span>  
> <span id="2.1.51">According to the phrase or the addition</span>  
> <span id="2.1.52">Of man and country.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**REYNALDO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.53">Very good, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.54">And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was
> I</span>  
> <span id="2.1.55">about to say? By the mass, I was about to
> say</span>  
> <span id="2.1.56">something: where did I leave?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**REYNALDO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.57">At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or
> so,'</span>  
> <span id="2.1.58">and 'gentleman.'</span>  

<span id="speech19">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.59">At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.60">He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.61">I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.62">Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you
> say,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.63">There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's
> rouse;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.64">There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.65">'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'</span>  
> <span id="2.1.66">Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.67">See you now;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.68">Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of
> truth:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.69">And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.70">With windlasses and with assays of bias,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.71">By indirections find directions out:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.72">So by my former lecture and advice,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.73">Shall you my son. You have me, have you
> not?</span>  

<span id="speech20">**REYNALDO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.74">My lord, I have.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.75">God be wi' you; fare you well.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**REYNALDO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.76">Good my lord!</span>  

<span id="speech23">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.77">Observe his inclination in yourself.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**REYNALDO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.78">I shall, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.79">And let him ply his music.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**REYNALDO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.80">Well, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.81">Farewell!</span>  
>
> *Exit REYNALDO*
>
> *Enter OPHELIA*
>
> <span id="2.1.82">How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?</span>  

<span id="speech28">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.83">O, my lord, my lord, I have been so
> affrighted!</span>  

<span id="speech29">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.84">With what, i' the name of God?</span>  

<span id="speech30">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.85">My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.86">Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.87">No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.88">Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.89">Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each
> other;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.90">And with a look so piteous in purport</span>  
> <span id="2.1.91">As if he had been loosed out of hell</span>  
> <span id="2.1.92">To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.93">Mad for thy love?</span>  

<span id="speech32">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.94">My lord, I do not know;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.95">But truly, I do fear it.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.96">What said he?</span>  

<span id="speech34">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.97">He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.98">Then goes he to the length of all his arm;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.99">And, with his other hand thus o'er his
> brow,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.100">He falls to such perusal of my face</span>  
> <span id="2.1.101">As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.102">At last, a little shaking of mine arm</span>  
> <span id="2.1.103">And thrice his head thus waving up and
> down,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.104">He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</span>  
> <span id="2.1.105">As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</span>  
> <span id="2.1.106">And end his being: that done, he lets me
> go:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.107">And, with his head over his shoulder
> turn'd,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.108">He seem'd to find his way without his
> eyes;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.109">For out o' doors he went without their
> helps,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.110">And, to the last, bended their light on
> me.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.111">Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.112">This is the very ecstasy of love,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.113">Whose violent property fordoes itself</span>  
> <span id="2.1.114">And leads the will to desperate
> undertakings</span>  
> <span id="2.1.115">As oft as any passion under heaven</span>  
> <span id="2.1.116">That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.117">What, have you given him any hard words of
> late?</span>  

<span id="speech36">**OPHELIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.118">No, my good lord, but, as you did command,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.119">I did repel his fetters and denied</span>  
> <span id="2.1.120">His access to me.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.121">That hath made him mad.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.122">I am sorry that with better heed and
> judgment</span>  
> <span id="2.1.123">I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but
> trifle,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.124">And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my
> jealousy!</span>  
> <span id="2.1.125">By heaven, it is as proper to our age</span>  
> <span id="2.1.126">To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions</span>  
> <span id="2.1.127">As it is common for the younger sort</span>  
> <span id="2.1.128">To lack discretion. Come, go we to the
> king:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.129">This must be known; which, being kept close,
> might</span>  
> <span id="2.1.130">move</span>  
> <span id="2.1.131">More grief to hide than hate to utter
> love.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
