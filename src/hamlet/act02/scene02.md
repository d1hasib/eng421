## SCENE II

### A room in the castle.

> *Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and
> Attendants*

<span id="speech1">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.1">Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.2">Moreover that we much did long to see you,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.3">The need we have to use you did provoke</span>  
> <span id="2.2.4">Our hasty sending. Something have you heard</span>  
> <span id="2.2.5">Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.6">Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man</span>  
> <span id="2.2.7">Resembles that it was. What it should be,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.8">More than his father's death, that thus hath put
> him</span>  
> <span id="2.2.9">So much from the understanding of himself,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.10">I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.11">That, being of so young days brought up with
> him,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.12">And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and
> havior,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.13">That you vouchsafe your rest here in our
> court</span>  
> <span id="2.2.14">Some little time: so by your companies</span>  
> <span id="2.2.15">To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.16">So much as from occasion you may glean,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.17">Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him
> thus,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.18">That, open'd, lies within our remedy.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="2.2.19">Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.20">And sure I am two men there are not living</span>  
> <span id="2.2.21">To whom he more adheres. If it will please
> you</span>  
> <span id="2.2.22">To show us so much gentry and good will</span>  
> <span id="2.2.23">As to expend your time with us awhile,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.24">For the supply and profit of our hope,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.25">Your visitation shall receive such thanks</span>  
> <span id="2.2.26">As fits a king's remembrance.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**ROSENCRANTZ**</span>

> <span id="2.2.27">Both your majesties</span>  
> <span id="2.2.28">Might, by the sovereign power you have of
> us,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.29">Put your dread pleasures more into command</span>  
> <span id="2.2.30">Than to entreaty.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**GUILDENSTERN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.31">But we both obey,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.32">And here give up ourselves, in the full
> bent</span>  
> <span id="2.2.33">To lay our service freely at your feet,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.34">To be commanded.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.35">Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle
> Guildenstern.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="2.2.36">Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle
> Rosencrantz:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.37">And I beseech you instantly to visit</span>  
> <span id="2.2.38">My too much changed son. Go, some of you,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.39">And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**GUILDENSTERN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.40">Heavens make our presence and our practises</span>  
> <span id="2.2.41">Pleasant and helpful to him!</span>  

<span id="speech8">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="2.2.42">Ay, amen!</span>  
>
> *Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants*
>
> *Enter POLONIUS*

<span id="speech9">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.43">The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.44">Are joyfully return'd.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.45">Thou still hast been the father of good
> news.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.46">Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.47">I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.48">Both to my God and to my gracious king:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.49">And I do think, or else this brain of mine</span>  
> <span id="2.2.50">Hunts not the trail of policy so sure</span>  
> <span id="2.2.51">As it hath used to do, that I have found</span>  
> <span id="2.2.52">The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.53">O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.54">Give first admittance to the ambassadors;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.55">My news shall be the fruit to that great
> feast.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.56">Thyself do grace to them, and bring them
> in.</span>  
>
> *Exit POLONIUS*
>
> <span id="2.2.57">He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath
> found</span>  
> <span id="2.2.58">The head and source of all your son's
> distemper.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="2.2.59">I doubt it is no other but the main;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.60">His father's death, and our o'erhasty
> marriage.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.61">Well, we shall sift him.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS*
>
> <span id="2.2.62">Welcome, my good friends!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.63">Say, Voltimand, what from our brother
> Norway?</span>  

<span id="speech17">**VOLTIMAND**</span>

> <span id="2.2.64">Most fair return of greetings and desires.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.65">Upon our first, he sent out to suppress</span>  
> <span id="2.2.66">His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd</span>  
> <span id="2.2.67">To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.68">But, better look'd into, he truly found</span>  
> <span id="2.2.69">It was against your highness: whereat
> grieved,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.70">That so his sickness, age and impotence</span>  
> <span id="2.2.71">Was falsely borne in hand, sends out
> arrests</span>  
> <span id="2.2.72">On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.73">Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine</span>  
> <span id="2.2.74">Makes vow before his uncle never more</span>  
> <span id="2.2.75">To give the assay of arms against your
> majesty.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.76">Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.77">Gives him three thousand crowns in annual
> fee,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.78">And his commission to employ those
> soldiers,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.79">So levied as before, against the Polack:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.80">With an entreaty, herein further shown,</span>  
>
> *Giving a paper*
>
> <span id="2.2.81">That it might please you to give quiet pass</span>  
> <span id="2.2.82">Through your dominions for this enterprise,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.83">On such regards of safety and allowance</span>  
> <span id="2.2.84">As therein are set down.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.85">It likes us well;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.86">And at our more consider'd time well read,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.87">Answer, and think upon this business.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.88">Meantime we thank you for your well-took
> labour:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.89">Go to your rest; at night we'll feast
> together:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.90">Most welcome home!</span>  
>
> *Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS*

<span id="speech19">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.91">This business is well ended.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.92">My liege, and madam, to expostulate</span>  
> <span id="2.2.93">What majesty should be, what duty is,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.94">Why day is day, night night, and time is
> time,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.95">Were nothing but to waste night, day and
> time.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.96">Therefore, since brevity is the soul of
> wit,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.97">And tediousness the limbs and outward
> flourishes,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.98">I will be brief: your noble son is mad:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.99">Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.100">What is't but to be nothing else but mad?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.101">But let that go.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="2.2.102">More matter, with less art.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.103">Madam, I swear I use no art at all.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.104">That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis
> pity;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.105">And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.106">But farewell it, for I will use no art.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.107">Mad let us grant him, then: and now
> remains</span>  
> <span id="2.2.108">That we find out the cause of this effect,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.109">Or rather say, the cause of this defect,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.110">For this effect defective comes by cause:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.111">Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
> Perpend.</span>

<span id="speech23">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

<span id="speech25">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

<span id="speech26">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

<span id="speech27">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.146">Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.147">What might you think? No, I went round to

> <span id="2.2.148">And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:</span>

<span id="speech28">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.160">Do you think 'tis this?</span>  

<span id="speech29">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

> <span id="2.2.161">It may be, very likely.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

<span id="speech31">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.165">Not that I know.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

<span id="speech33">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.171">How may we try it further?</span>  

<span id="speech34">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

<span id="speech37">**KING CLAUDIUS**</span>

<span id="speech38">**QUEEN GERTRUDE**</span>

<span id="speech39">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

<span id="speech40">**HAMLET**</span>

<span id="speech41">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

<span id="speech42">**HAMLET**</span>

<span id="speech43">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.190">Not I, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech44">**HAMLET**</span>

<span id="speech45">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

<span id="speech46">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="2.2.193">Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to

<span id="speech47">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.195">That's very true, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech48">**HAMLET**</span>

<span id="speech55">**LORD POLONIUS**</span>

<span id="speech56">**HAMLET**</span>

> <span id="2.2.212">Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says

> <span id="2.2.214">wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber

> <span id="2.2.215">plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack

> <span id="2.2.216">wit, together with most weak hams: all which,

> <span id="2.2.217">though I most powerfully and potently believe,

> <span id="2.2.218">I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down,
