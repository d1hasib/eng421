<span id="speech1">**Citizens**</span>

<span id="speech2">**BRUTUS**</span>

<span id="speech3">**First Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.9">I will hear Brutus speak.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Second Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.10">I will hear Cassius; and compare their

> *Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpit*

<span id="speech5">**Third Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.12">The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!</span>  

<span id="speech6">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.13">Be patient till the last.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.14">Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for

> <span id="3.2.15">cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe

> <span id="3.2.16">for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour,
> that</span>  
> <span id="3.2.17">you may believe: censure me in your wisdom,
> and</span>  
> <span id="3.2.18">awake your senses, that you may the better
> judge.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.19">If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend
> of</span>  
> <span id="3.2.20">Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to
> Caesar</span>  
> <span id="3.2.21">was no less than his. If then that friend
> demand</span>  
> <span id="3.2.22">why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my
> answer:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.23">--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I
> loved</span>  
> <span id="3.2.24">Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living
> and</span>  
> <span id="3.2.25">die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to
> live</span>  
> <span id="3.2.26">all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for
> him;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.27">as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he
> was</span>  
> <span id="3.2.28">valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious,
> I</span>  
> <span id="3.2.29">slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for
> his</span>  
> <span id="3.2.30">fortune; honour for his valour; and death for
> his</span>  
> <span id="3.2.31">ambition. Who is here so base that would be
> a</span>  
> <span id="3.2.32">bondman? If any, speak; for him have I
> offended.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.33">Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman?
> If</span>  
> <span id="3.2.34">any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here
> so</span>  
> <span id="3.2.35">vile that will not love his country? If any,
> speak;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.36">for him have I offended. I pause for a

<span id="speech7">**All**</span>

> <span id="3.2.37">None, Brutus, none.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.38">Then none have I offended. I have done no more
> to</span>  
> <span id="3.2.39">Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question

> <span id="3.2.40">his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory

> <span id="3.2.41">extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his

<span id="speech9">**All**</span>

> <span id="3.2.50">Live, Brutus! live, live!</span>  

<span id="speech10">**First Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.59">Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**First Citizen**</span>

<span id="speech20">**Third Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.69">Let him go up into the public chair;</span>

> *Goes into the pulpit*

<span id="speech22">**Fourth Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.72">What does he say of Brutus?</span>  

<span id="speech23">**Third Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.73">He says, for Brutus' sake,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.74">He finds himself beholding to us all.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**Fourth Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.75">'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus

<span id="speech25">**First Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.76">This Caesar was a tyrant.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**Third Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.77">Nay, that's certain:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.78">We are blest that Rome is rid of him.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**Second Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.79">Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="3.2.80">You gentle Romans,--</span>  

<span id="speech29">**Citizens**</span>

> <span id="3.2.81">Peace, ho! let us hear him.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="3.2.82">Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
> ears;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.83">I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.84">The evil that men do lives after them;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.85">The good is oft interred with their bones;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.86">So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</span>  
> <span id="3.2.87">Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.88">If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.89">And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.90">Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--</span>  
> <span id="3.2.91">For Brutus is an honourable man;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.92">So are they all, all honourable men--</span>  
> <span id="3.2.93">Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.94">He was my friend, faithful and just to me:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.95">But Brutus says he was ambitious;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.96">And Brutus is an honourable man.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.97">He hath brought many captives home to Rome</span>  
> <span id="3.2.98">Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.99">Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.100">When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath
> wept:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.101">Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.102">Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.103">And Brutus is an honourable man.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.104">You all did see that on the Lupercal</span>  
> <span id="3.2.105">I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.106">Which he did thrice refuse: was this
> ambition?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.107">Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.108">And, sure, he is an honourable man.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.109">I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.110">But here I am to speak what I do know.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.111">You all did love him once, not without

> <span id="3.2.112">What cause withholds you then, to mourn for
> him?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.113">O judgment! thou art fled to brutish
> beasts,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.114">And men have lost their reason. Bear with

> <span id="3.2.115">My heart is in the coffin there with
> Caesar,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.116">And I must pause till it come back to me.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**First Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.117">Methinks there is much reason in his
> sayings.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**Second Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.118">If thou consider rightly of the matter,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.119">Caesar has had great wrong.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**Third Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.120">Has he, masters?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.121">I fear there will a worse come in his

<span id="speech34">**Fourth Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.122">Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the
> crown;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.123">Therefore 'tis certain he was not
> ambitious.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**First Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.124">If it be found so, some will dear abide
> it.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**Second Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.125">Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with
> weeping.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**Third Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.126">There's not a nobler man in Rome than
> Antony.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**Fourth Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.127">Now mark him, he begins again to speak.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="3.2.128">But yesterday the word of Caesar might</span>  
> <span id="3.2.129">Have stood against the world; now lies he
> there.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.130">And none so poor to do him reverence.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.131">O masters, if I were disposed to stir</span>  
> <span id="3.2.132">Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.133">I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius
> wrong,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.134">Who, you all know, are honourable men:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.135">I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</span>  
> <span id="3.2.136">To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and
> you,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.137">Than I will wrong such honourable men.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.138">But here's a parchment with the seal of
> Caesar;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.139">I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.140">Let but the commons hear this testament--</span>  
> <span id="3.2.141">Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--</span>  
> <span id="3.2.142">And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's
> wounds</span>  
> <span id="3.2.143">And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.144">Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.145">And, dying, mention it within their wills,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.146">Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</span>  
> <span id="3.2.147">Unto their issue.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**Fourth Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.148">We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**All**</span>

> <span id="3.2.149">The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's

<span id="speech42">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="3.2.150">Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read

> <span id="3.2.151">It is not meet you know how Caesar loved

> <span id="3.2.152">You are not wood, you are not stones, but

> <span id="3.2.153">And, being men, bearing the will of

> <span id="3.2.154">It will inflame you, it will make you mad:</span>

> <span id="3.2.156">For, if you should, O, what would come of

<span id="speech43">**Fourth Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.157">Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.158">You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.</span>  

<span id="speech44">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="3.2.159">Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.160">I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.161">I fear I wrong the honourable men</span>  
> <span id="3.2.162">Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear
> it.</span>  

<span id="speech45">**Fourth Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.163">They were traitors: honourable men!</span>  

<span id="speech46">**All**</span>

> <span id="3.2.164">The will! the testament!</span>  

<span id="speech47">**Second Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.165">They were villains, murderers: the will! read the

<span id="speech48">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="3.2.166">You will compel me, then, to read the

> <span id="3.2.167">Then make a ring about the corpse of

> <span id="3.2.168">And let me show you him that made the

<span id="speech49">**Several Citizens**</span>

> <span id="3.2.170">Come down.</span>  

<span id="speech50">**Second Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.2.171">Descend.</span>

<span id="speech54">**Second Citizen**</span>

<span id="speech55">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="3.2.176">Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.</span>  

<span id="speech56">**Several Citizens**</span>

> <span id="3.2.186">And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.187">Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,</span>
