<span id="speech1">**CINNA THE POET**</span>

> <span id="3.3.1">I dreamt to-night that I did feast with

> <span id="3.3.3">I have no will to wander forth of doors,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.4">Yet something leads me forth.</span>  
>

<span id="speech11">**Second Citizen**</span>

> <span id="3.3.17">That's as much as to say, they are fools that
