## SCENE I

### Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.

> *A crowd of people; among them ARTEMIDORUS and the Soothsayer.
> Flourish. Enter CAESAR, BRUTUS, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS,
> METELLUS CIMBER, TREBONIUS, CINNA, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POPILIUS, PUBLIUS,
> and others*

<span id="speech1">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="3.1.1">\[To the Soothsayer\] The ides of March are
> come.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Soothsayer**</span>

> <span id="3.1.2">Ay, Caesar; but not gone.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**ARTEMIDORUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.3">Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**DECIUS BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.4">Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.5">At your best leisure, this his humble suit.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**ARTEMIDORUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.6">O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit</span>  
> <span id="3.1.7">That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great
> Caesar.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="3.1.8">What touches us ourself shall be last
> served.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**ARTEMIDORUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.9">Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="3.1.10">What, is the fellow mad?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**PUBLIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.11">Sirrah, give place.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.12">What, urge you your petitions in the
> street?</span>  
> <span id="3.1.13">Come to the Capitol.</span>  
>
> *CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest following*

<span id="speech11">**POPILIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.14">I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.15">What enterprise, Popilius?</span>  

<span id="speech13">**POPILIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.16">Fare you well.</span>  
>
> *Advances to CAESAR*

<span id="speech14">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.17">What said Popilius Lena?</span>  

<span id="speech15">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.18">He wish'd to-day our enterprise might
> thrive.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.19">I fear our purpose is discovered.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.20">Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.21">Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.22">Brutus, what shall be done? If this be
> known,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.23">Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.24">For I will slay myself.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.25">Cassius, be constant:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.26">Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.27">For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not
> change.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.28">Trebonius knows his time; for, look you,
> Brutus.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.29">He draws Mark Antony out of the way.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS*

<span id="speech20">**DECIUS BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.30">Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.31">And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.32">He is address'd: press near and second him.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**CINNA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.33">Casca, you are the first that rears your
> hand.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="3.1.34">Are we all ready? What is now amiss</span>  
> <span id="3.1.35">That Caesar and his senate must redress?</span>  

<span id="speech24">**METELLUS CIMBER**</span>

> <span id="3.1.36">Most high, most mighty, and most puissant
> Caesar,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.37">Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat</span>  
> <span id="3.1.38">An humble heart,--</span>  
>
> *Kneeling*

<span id="speech25">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="3.1.39">I must prevent thee, Cimber.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.40">These couchings and these lowly courtesies</span>  
> <span id="3.1.41">Might fire the blood of ordinary men,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.42">And turn pre-ordinance and first decree</span>  
> <span id="3.1.43">Into the law of children. Be not fond,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.44">To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood</span>  
> <span id="3.1.45">That will be thaw'd from the true quality</span>  
> <span id="3.1.46">With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet
> words,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.47">Low-crooked court'sies and base
> spaniel-fawning.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.48">Thy brother by decree is banished:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.49">If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for
> him,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.50">I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.51">Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without
> cause</span>  
> <span id="3.1.52">Will he be satisfied.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**METELLUS CIMBER**</span>

> <span id="3.1.53">Is there no voice more worthy than my own</span>  
> <span id="3.1.54">To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear</span>  
> <span id="3.1.55">For the repealing of my banish'd brother?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.56">I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery,
> Caesar;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.57">Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may</span>  
> <span id="3.1.58">Have an immediate freedom of repeal.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="3.1.59">What, Brutus!</span>  

<span id="speech29">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.60">Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.61">As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.62">To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.63">I could be well moved, if I were as you:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.64">If I could pray to move, prayers would move
> me:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.65">But I am constant as the northern star,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.66">Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality</span>  
> <span id="3.1.67">There is no fellow in the firmament.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.68">The skies are painted with unnumber'd
> sparks,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.69">They are all fire and every one doth shine,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.70">But there's but one in all doth hold his
> place:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.71">So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with
> men,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.72">And men are flesh and blood, and
> apprehensive;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.73">Yet in the number I do know but one</span>  
> <span id="3.1.74">That unassailable holds on his rank,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.75">Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.76">Let me a little show it, even in this;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.77">That I was constant Cimber should be
> banish'd,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.78">And constant do remain to keep him so.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**CINNA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.79">O Caesar,--</span>  

<span id="speech32">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="3.1.80">Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?</span>  

<span id="speech33">**DECIUS BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.81">Great Caesar,--</span>  

<span id="speech34">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="3.1.82">Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?</span>  

<span id="speech35">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.83">Speak, hands for me!</span>  
>
> *CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and BRUTUS stab CAESAR*

<span id="speech36">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="3.1.84">Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.</span>  
>
> *Dies*

<span id="speech37">**CINNA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.85">Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!</span>  
> <span id="3.1.86">Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the
> streets.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.87">Some to the common pulpits, and cry out</span>  
> <span id="3.1.88">'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'</span>  

<span id="speech39">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.89">People and senators, be not affrighted;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.90">Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is
> paid.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.91">Go to the pulpit, Brutus.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**DECIUS BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.92">And Cassius too.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.93">Where's Publius?</span>  

<span id="speech43">**CINNA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.94">Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.</span>  

<span id="speech44">**METELLUS CIMBER**</span>

> <span id="3.1.95">Stand fast together, lest some friend of
> Caesar's</span>  
> <span id="3.1.96">Should chance--</span>  

<span id="speech45">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.97">Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.98">There is no harm intended to your person,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.99">Nor to no Roman else: so tell them,
> Publius.</span>  

<span id="speech46">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.100">And leave us, Publius; lest that the
> people,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.101">Rushing on us, should do your age some
> mischief.</span>  

<span id="speech47">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.102">Do so: and let no man abide this deed,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.103">But we the doers.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter TREBONIUS*

<span id="speech48">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.104">Where is Antony?</span>  

<span id="speech49">**TREBONIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.105">Fled to his house amazed:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.106">Men, wives and children stare, cry out and
> run</span>  
> <span id="3.1.107">As it were doomsday.</span>  

<span id="speech50">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.108">Fates, we will know your pleasures:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.109">That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the
> time</span>  
> <span id="3.1.110">And drawing days out, that men stand upon.</span>  

<span id="speech51">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.111">Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life</span>  
> <span id="3.1.112">Cuts off so many years of fearing death.</span>  

<span id="speech52">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.113">Grant that, and then is death a benefit:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.114">So are we Caesar's friends, that have
> abridged</span>  
> <span id="3.1.115">His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans,
> stoop,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.116">And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's
> blood</span>  
> <span id="3.1.117">Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.118">Then walk we forth, even to the
> market-place,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.119">And, waving our red weapons o'er our
> heads,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.120">Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and
> liberty!'</span>  

<span id="speech53">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.121">Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence</span>  
> <span id="3.1.122">Shall this our lofty scene be acted over</span>  
> <span id="3.1.123">In states unborn and accents yet unknown!</span>  

<span id="speech54">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.124">How many times shall Caesar bleed in
> sport,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.125">That now on Pompey's basis lies along</span>  
> <span id="3.1.126">No worthier than the dust!</span>  

<span id="speech55">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.127">So oft as that shall be,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.128">So often shall the knot of us be call'd</span>  
> <span id="3.1.129">The men that gave their country liberty.</span>  

<span id="speech56">**DECIUS BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.130">What, shall we forth?</span>  

<span id="speech57">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.131">Ay, every man away:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.132">Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his

> <span id="3.1.133">With the most boldest and best hearts of

>
> *Enter a Servant*

<span id="speech58">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.134">Soft! who comes here? A friend of
> Antony's.</span>  

<span id="speech59">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="3.1.135">Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.136">Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.137">And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.138">Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and
> honest;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.139">Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and
> loving:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.140">Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.141">Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved
> him.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.142">If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony</span>  
> <span id="3.1.143">May safely come to him, and be resolved</span>  
> <span id="3.1.144">How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.145">Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead</span>  
> <span id="3.1.146">So well as Brutus living; but will follow</span>  
> <span id="3.1.147">The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus</span>  
> <span id="3.1.148">Thorough the hazards of this untrod state</span>  
> <span id="3.1.149">With all true faith. So says my master
> Antony.</span>  

<span id="speech60">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.150">Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.151">I never thought him worse.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.152">Tell him, so please him come unto this

> <span id="3.1.153">He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.154">Depart untouch'd.</span>  

<span id="speech61">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="3.1.155">I'll fetch him presently.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech62">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.156">I know that we shall have him well to

<span id="speech63">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.157">I wish we may: but yet have I a mind</span>  
> <span id="3.1.158">That fears him much; and my misgiving
> still</span>  
> <span id="3.1.159">Falls shrewdly to the purpose.</span>  

<span id="speech64">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.160">But here comes Antony.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter ANTONY*
>
> <span id="3.1.161">Welcome, Mark Antony.</span>  

<span id="speech65">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="3.1.162">O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?</span>

> <span id="3.1.165">I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,</span>

> <span id="3.1.170">With the most noble blood of all this

> <span id="3.1.171">I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,</span>

<span id="speech66">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.178">O Antony, beg not your death of us.</span>

<span id="speech72">**CASSIUS**</span>

<span id="speech73">**ANTONY**</span>

<span id="speech75">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="3.1.243">That's all I seek:</span>

<span id="speech78">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="3.1.254">By your pardon;</span>

<span id="speech80">**BRUTUS**</span>

<span id="speech81">**ANTONY**</span>
