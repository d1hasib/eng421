### Rome. A street.

> *Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners*

<span id="speech1">**FLAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.1">Hence! home, you idle creatures get you
> home:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.2">Is this a holiday? what! know you not,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.3">Being mechanical, you ought not walk</span>  
> <span id="1.1.4">Upon a labouring day without the sign</span>  
> <span id="1.1.5">Of your profession? Speak, what trade art
> thou?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**First Commoner**</span>

> <span id="1.1.6">Why, sir, a carpenter.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**MARULLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.7">Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.8">What dost thou with thy best apparel on?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.9">You, sir, what trade are you?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Second Commoner**</span>

> <span id="1.1.10">Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am
> but,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.11">as you would say, a cobbler.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**MARULLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.12">But what trade art thou? answer me
> directly.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Second Commoner**</span>

> <span id="1.1.13">A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a
> safe</span>  
> <span id="1.1.14">conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad
> soles.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**MARULLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.15">What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what
> trade?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**Second Commoner**</span>

> <span id="1.1.16">Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me:
> yet,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.17">if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**MARULLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.18">What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy
> fellow!</span>  

<span id="speech10">**Second Commoner**</span>

> <span id="1.1.19">Why, sir, cobble you.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**FLAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.20">Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**Second Commoner**</span>

> <span id="1.1.21">Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl:
> I</span>  
> <span id="1.1.22">meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor
> women's</span>  
> <span id="1.1.23">matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a
> surgeon</span>  
> <span id="1.1.24">to old shoes; when they are in great danger,
> I</span>  
> <span id="1.1.25">recover them. As proper men as ever trod
> upon</span>  
> <span id="1.1.26">neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**FLAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.27">But wherefore art not in thy shop today?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.28">Why dost thou lead these men about the
> streets?</span>  

<span id="speech14">**Second Commoner**</span>

> <span id="1.1.29">Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get
> myself</span>  
> <span id="1.1.30">into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make
> holiday,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.31">to see Caesar and to rejoice in his
> triumph.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**MARULLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.32">Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he
> home?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.33">What tributaries follow him to Rome,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.34">To grace in captive bonds his
> chariot-wheels?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.35">You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless
> things!</span>  
> <span id="1.1.36">O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.37">Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</span>  
> <span id="1.1.38">Have you climb'd up to walls and
> battlements,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.39">To towers and windows, yea, to
> chimney-tops,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.40">Your infants in your arms, and there have
> sat</span>  
> <span id="1.1.41">The livelong day, with patient expectation,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.42">To see great Pompey pass the streets of
> Rome:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.43">And when you saw his chariot but appear,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.44">Have you not made an universal shout,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.45">That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.46">To hear the replication of your sounds</span>  
> <span id="1.1.47">Made in her concave shores?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.48">And do you now put on your best attire?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.49">And do you now cull out a holiday?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.50">And do you now strew flowers in his way</span>  
> <span id="1.1.51">That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be
> gone!</span>  
> <span id="1.1.52">Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.53">Pray to the gods to intermit the plague</span>  
> <span id="1.1.54">That needs must light on this ingratitude.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**FLAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.55">Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this
> fault,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.56">Assemble all the poor men of your sort;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.57">Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your
> tears</span>  
> <span id="1.1.58">Into the channel, till the lowest stream</span>  
> <span id="1.1.59">Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt all the Commoners*
>
> <span id="1.1.60">See whether their basest metal be not
> moved;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.61">They vanish tongue-tied in their
> guiltiness.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.62">Go you down that way towards the Capitol;</span>  

<span id="speech17">**This way will I**</span>

> <span id="1.1.63">disrobe the images,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.64">If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**MARULLUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.65">May we do so?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.66">You know it is the feast of Lupercal.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**FLAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.67">It is no matter; let no images</span>  
> <span id="1.1.68">Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.69">And drive away the vulgar from the streets:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.70">So do you too, where you perceive them
> thick.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.71">These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's
> wing</span>  
> <span id="1.1.72">Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.73">Who else would soar above the view of men</span>  
> <span id="1.1.74">And keep us all in servile fearfulness.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
