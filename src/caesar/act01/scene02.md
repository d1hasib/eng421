## SCENE II

### A public place.

> *Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course; CALPURNIA, PORTIA,
> DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd
> following, among them a Soothsayer*

<span id="speech1">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.1">Calpurnia!</span>  

<span id="speech2">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.2">Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.3">Calpurnia!</span>  

<span id="speech4">**CALPURNIA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.4">Here, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.5">Stand you directly in Antonius' way,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.6">When he doth run his course. Antonius!</span>  

<span id="speech6">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="1.2.7">Caesar, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.8">Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.9">To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.10">The barren, touched in this holy chase,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.11">Shake off their sterile curse.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="1.2.12">I shall remember:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.13">When Caesar says 'do this,' it is
> perform'd.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.14">Set on; and leave no ceremony out.</span>  
>
> *Flourish*

<span id="speech10">**Soothsayer**</span>

> <span id="1.2.15">Caesar!</span>  

<span id="speech11">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.16">Ha! who calls?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.17">Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!</span>  

<span id="speech13">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.18">Who is it in the press that calls on me?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.19">I hear a tongue, shriller than all the
> music,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.20">Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to
> hear.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**Soothsayer**</span>

> <span id="1.2.21">Beware the ides of March.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.22">What man is that?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.23">A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of
> March.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.24">Set him before me; let me see his face.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.25">Fellow, come from the throng; look upon
> Caesar.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.26">What say'st thou to me now? speak once
> again.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**Soothsayer**</span>

> <span id="1.2.27">Beware the ides of March.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.28">He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.</span>  
>
> *Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS*

<span id="speech22">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.29">Will you go see the order of the course?</span>  

<span id="speech23">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.30">Not I.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.31">I pray you, do.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.32">I am not gamesome: I do lack some part</span>  
> <span id="1.2.33">Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.34">Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.35">I'll leave you.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.36">Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.37">I have not from your eyes that gentleness</span>  
> <span id="1.2.38">And show of love as I was wont to have:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.39">You bear too stubborn and too strange a
> hand</span>  
> <span id="1.2.40">Over your friend that loves you.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.41">Cassius,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.42">Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.43">I turn the trouble of my countenance</span>  
> <span id="1.2.44">Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</span>  
> <span id="1.2.45">Of late with passions of some difference,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.46">Conceptions only proper to myself,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.47">Which give some soil perhaps to my
> behaviors;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.48">But let not therefore my good friends be
> grieved--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.49">Among which number, Cassius, be you one--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.50">Nor construe any further my neglect,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.51">Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.52">Forgets the shows of love to other men.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.53">Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your
> passion;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.54">By means whereof this breast of mine hath
> buried</span>  
> <span id="1.2.55">Thoughts of great value, worthy
> cogitations.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.56">Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your
> face?</span>  

<span id="speech29">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.57">No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.58">But by reflection, by some other things.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.59">'Tis just:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.60">And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.61">That you have no such mirrors as will turn</span>  
> <span id="1.2.62">Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.63">That you might see your shadow. I have
> heard,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.64">Where many of the best respect in Rome,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.65">Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</span>  
> <span id="1.2.66">And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.67">Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.68">Into what dangers would you lead me,
> Cassius,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.69">That you would have me seek into myself</span>  
> <span id="1.2.70">For that which is not in me?</span>  

<span id="speech32">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.71">Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to
> hear:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.72">And since you know you cannot see yourself</span>  
> <span id="1.2.73">So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.74">Will modestly discover to yourself</span>  
> <span id="1.2.75">That of yourself which you yet know not of.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.76">And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.77">Were I a common laugher, or did use</span>  
> <span id="1.2.78">To stale with ordinary oaths my love</span>  
> <span id="1.2.79">To every new protester; if you know</span>  
> <span id="1.2.80">That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</span>  
> <span id="1.2.81">And after scandal them, or if you know</span>  
> <span id="1.2.82">That I profess myself in banqueting</span>  
> <span id="1.2.83">To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</span>  
>
> *Flourish, and shout*

<span id="speech33">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.84">What means this shouting? I do fear, the
> people</span>  
> <span id="1.2.85">Choose Caesar for their king.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.86">Ay, do you fear it?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.87">Then must I think you would not have it so.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.88">I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.89">But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.90">What is it that you would impart to me?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.91">If it be aught toward the general good,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.92">Set honour in one eye and death i' the
> other,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.93">And I will look on both indifferently,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.94">For let the gods so speed me as I love</span>  
> <span id="1.2.95">The name of honour more than I fear death.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.96">I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.97">As well as I do know your outward favour.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.98">Well, honour is the subject of my story.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.99">I cannot tell what you and other men</span>  
> <span id="1.2.100">Think of this life; but, for my single
> self,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.101">I had as lief not be as live to be</span>  
> <span id="1.2.102">In awe of such a thing as I myself.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.103">I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.104">We both have fed as well, and we can both</span>  
> <span id="1.2.105">Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.106">For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.107">The troubled Tiber chafing with her
> shores,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.108">Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius,
> now</span>  
> <span id="1.2.109">Leap in with me into this angry flood,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.110">And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.111">Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</span>  
> <span id="1.2.112">And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.113">The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</span>  
> <span id="1.2.114">With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</span>  
> <span id="1.2.115">And stemming it with hearts of
> controversy;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.116">But ere we could arrive the point
> proposed,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.117">Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I
> sink!'</span>  
> <span id="1.2.118">I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.119">Did from the flames of Troy upon his
> shoulder</span>  
> <span id="1.2.120">The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of
> Tiber</span>  
> <span id="1.2.121">Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</span>  
> <span id="1.2.122">Is now become a god, and Cassius is</span>  
> <span id="1.2.123">A wretched creature and must bend his
> body,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.124">If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.125">He had a fever when he was in Spain,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.126">And when the fit was on him, I did mark</span>  
> <span id="1.2.127">How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did
> shake;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.128">His coward lips did from their colour fly,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.129">And that same eye whose bend doth awe the
> world</span>  
> <span id="1.2.130">Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.131">Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the
> Romans</span>  
> <span id="1.2.132">Mark him and write his speeches in their
> books,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.133">Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink,
> Titinius,'</span>  
> <span id="1.2.134">As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</span>  
> <span id="1.2.135">A man of such a feeble temper should</span>  
> <span id="1.2.136">So get the start of the majestic world</span>  
> <span id="1.2.137">And bear the palm alone.</span>  
>
> *Shout. Flourish*

<span id="speech37">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.138">Another general shout!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.139">I do believe that these applauses are</span>  
> <span id="1.2.140">For some new honours that are heap'd on
> Caesar.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.141">Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow
> world</span>  
> <span id="1.2.142">Like a Colossus, and we petty men</span>  
> <span id="1.2.143">Walk under his huge legs and peep about</span>  
> <span id="1.2.144">To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.145">Men at some time are masters of their
> fates:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.146">The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our
> stars,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.147">But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.148">Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that
> 'Caesar'?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.149">Why should that name be sounded more than
> yours?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.150">Write them together, yours is as fair a
> name;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.151">Sound them, it doth become the mouth as
> well;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.152">Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with
> 'em,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.153">Brutus will start a spirit as soon as
> Caesar.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.154">Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.155">Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.156">That he is grown so great? Age, thou art
> shamed!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.157">Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble
> bloods!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.158">When went there by an age, since the great
> flood,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.159">But it was famed with more than with one
> man?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.160">When could they say till now, that talk'd of
> Rome,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.161">That her wide walls encompass'd but one
> man?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.162">Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.163">When there is in it but one only man.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.164">O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.165">There was a Brutus once that would have
> brook'd</span>  
> <span id="1.2.166">The eternal devil to keep his state in
> Rome</span>  
> <span id="1.2.167">As easily as a king.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.168">That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.169">What you would work me to, I have some
> aim:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.170">How I have thought of this and of these
> times,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.171">I shall recount hereafter; for this
> present,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.172">I would not, so with love I might entreat
> you,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.173">Be any further moved. What you have said</span>  
> <span id="1.2.174">I will consider; what you have to say</span>  
> <span id="1.2.175">I will with patience hear, and find a time</span>  
> <span id="1.2.176">Both meet to hear and answer such high
> things.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.177">Till then, my noble friend, chew upon
> this:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.178">Brutus had rather be a villager</span>  
> <span id="1.2.179">Than to repute himself a son of Rome</span>  
> <span id="1.2.180">Under these hard conditions as this time</span>  
> <span id="1.2.181">Is like to lay upon us.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.182">I am glad that my weak words</span>  
> <span id="1.2.183">Have struck but thus much show of fire from
> Brutus.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.184">The games are done and Caesar is
> returning.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.185">As they pass by, pluck Casca by the
> sleeve;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.186">And he will, after his sour fashion, tell
> you</span>  
> <span id="1.2.187">What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter CAESAR and his Train*

<span id="speech43">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.188">I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.189">The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.190">And all the rest look like a chidden
> train:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.191">Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero</span>  
> <span id="1.2.192">Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</span>  
> <span id="1.2.193">As we have seen him in the Capitol,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.194">Being cross'd in conference by some
> senators.</span>  

<span id="speech44">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.195">Casca will tell us what the matter is.</span>  

<span id="speech45">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.196">Antonius!</span>  

<span id="speech46">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="1.2.197">Caesar?</span>  

<span id="speech47">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.198">Let me have men about me that are fat;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.199">Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o'
> nights:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.200">Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.201">He thinks too much: such men are
> dangerous.</span>  

<span id="speech48">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="1.2.202">Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.203">He is a noble Roman and well given.</span>  

<span id="speech49">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="1.2.204">Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.205">Yet if my name were liable to fear,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.206">I do not know the man I should avoid</span>  
> <span id="1.2.207">So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads
> much;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.208">He is a great observer and he looks</span>  
> <span id="1.2.209">Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no
> plays,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.210">As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.211">Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a
> sort</span>  
> <span id="1.2.212">As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his
> spirit</span>  
> <span id="1.2.213">That could be moved to smile at any thing.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.214">Such men as he be never at heart's ease</span>  
> <span id="1.2.215">Whiles they behold a greater than
> themselves,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.216">And therefore are they very dangerous.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.217">I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd</span>  
> <span id="1.2.218">Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.219">Come on my right hand, for this ear is
> deaf,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.220">And tell me truly what thou think'st of

>
> *Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA*

<span id="speech50">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.221">You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with
> me?</span>  

<span id="speech51">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.222">Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced
> to-day,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.223">That Caesar looks so sad.</span>  

<span id="speech52">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.224">Why, you were with him, were you not?</span>  

<span id="speech53">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.225">I should not then ask Casca what had
> chanced.</span>  

<span id="speech54">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.226">Why, there was a crown offered him: and
> being</span>  
> <span id="1.2.227">offered him, he put it by with the back of his
> hand,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.228">thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.</span>  

<span id="speech55">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.229">What was the second noise for?</span>  

<span id="speech56">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.230">Why, for that too.</span>  

<span id="speech57">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.231">They shouted thrice: what was the last cry
> for?</span>  

<span id="speech58">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.232">Why, for that too.</span>  

<span id="speech59">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.233">Was the crown offered him thrice?</span>  

<span id="speech60">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.234">Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice,
> every</span>  
> <span id="1.2.235">time gentler than other, and at every
> putting-by</span>  
> <span id="1.2.236">mine honest neighbours shouted.</span>

> <span id="1.2.237">Who offered him the crown?</span>  

<span id="speech62">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.238">Why, Antony.</span>  

<span id="speech63">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.239">Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</span>  

<span id="speech64">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.240">I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of
> it:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.241">it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw
> Mark</span>  
> <span id="1.2.242">Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a
> crown</span>  
> <span id="1.2.243">neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I
> told</span>  
> <span id="1.2.244">you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to
> my</span>  
> <span id="1.2.245">thinking, he would fain have had it. Then
> he</span>  
> <span id="1.2.246">offered it to him again; then he put it by
> again:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.247">but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay
> his</span>  
> <span id="1.2.248">fingers off it. And then he offered it the
> third</span>  
> <span id="1.2.249">time; he put it the third time by: and still as
> he</span>  
> <span id="1.2.250">refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped
> their</span>  
> <span id="1.2.251">chapped hands and threw up their sweaty
> night-caps</span>  
> <span id="1.2.252">and uttered such a deal of stinking breath
> because</span>  
> <span id="1.2.253">Caesar refused the crown that it had almost
> choked</span>  
> <span id="1.2.254">Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it:
> and</span>  
> <span id="1.2.255">for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear
> of</span>  
> <span id="1.2.256">opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</span>  

<span id="speech65">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.257">But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar
> swound?</span>  

<span id="speech66">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.258">He fell down in the market-place, and foamed
> at</span>  
> <span id="1.2.259">mouth, and was speechless.</span>  

<span id="speech67">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.260">'Tis very like: he hath the failing
> sickness.</span>  

<span id="speech68">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.261">No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.262">And honest Casca, we have the falling
> sickness.</span>  

<span id="speech69">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.263">I know not what you mean by that; but, I am
> sure,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.264">Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did
> not</span>  
> <span id="1.2.265">clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased
> and</span>  
> <span id="1.2.266">displeased them, as they use to do the players
> in</span>  
> <span id="1.2.267">the theatre, I am no true man.</span>  

<span id="speech70">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.268">What said he when he came unto himself?</span>  

<span id="speech71">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.269">Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived
> the</span>  
> <span id="1.2.270">common herd was glad he refused the crown,
> he</span>  
> <span id="1.2.271">plucked me ope his doublet and offered them
> his</span>  
> <span id="1.2.272">throat to cut. An I had been a man of any</span>  
> <span id="1.2.273">occupation, if I would not have taken him at a
> word,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.274">I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And
> so</span>  
> <span id="1.2.275">he fell. When he came to himself again, he
> said,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.276">If he had done or said any thing amiss, he
> desired</span>  
> <span id="1.2.277">their worships to think it was his infirmity.
> Three</span>  
> <span id="1.2.278">or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas,
> good</span>  
> <span id="1.2.279">soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts:
> but</span>  
> <span id="1.2.280">there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar
> had</span>  
> <span id="1.2.281">stabbed their mothers, they would have done no
> less.</span>  

<span id="speech72">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.282">And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</span>  

<span id="speech73">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.283">Ay.</span>  

<span id="speech74">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.284">Did Cicero say any thing?</span>  

<span id="speech75">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.285">Ay, he spoke Greek.</span>  

<span id="speech76">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.286">To what effect?</span>  

<span id="speech77">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.287">Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i'
> the</span>  
> <span id="1.2.288">face again: but those that understood him smiled
> at</span>  
> <span id="1.2.289">one another and shook their heads; but, for mine
> own</span>  
> <span id="1.2.290">part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you
> more</span>  
> <span id="1.2.291">news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling
> scarfs</span>  
> <span id="1.2.292">off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare
> you</span>  
> <span id="1.2.293">well. There was more foolery yet, if I
> could</span>  
> <span id="1.2.294">remember it.</span>  

<span id="speech78">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.295">Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?</span>  

<span id="speech79">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.296">No, I am promised forth.</span>  

<span id="speech80">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.297">Will you dine with me to-morrow?</span>  

<span id="speech81">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.298">Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your
> dinner</span>  
> <span id="1.2.299">worth the eating.</span>  

<span id="speech82">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.300">Good: I will expect you.</span>  

<span id="speech83">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.301">Do so. Farewell, both.</span>

<span id="speech84">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.302">What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.303">He was quick mettle when he went to

<span id="speech85">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.304">So is he now in execution</span>  
> <span id="1.2.305">Of any bold or noble enterprise,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.306">However he puts on this tardy form.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.307">This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,</span>

> <span id="1.2.309">With better appetite.</span>  

<span id="speech86">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.313">Come home to me, and I will wait for you.</span>  

<span id="speech87">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.314">I will do so: till then, think of the

>
> *Exit BRUTUS*
