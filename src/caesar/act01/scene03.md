## SCENE III

### The same. A street.

> *Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides, CASCA, with his
> sword drawn, and CICERO*

<span id="speech1">**CICERO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.1">Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?</span>  
> <span id="1.3.2">Why are you breathless? and why stare you
> so?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.3">Are not you moved, when all the sway of
> earth</span>  
> <span id="1.3.4">Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.5">I have seen tempests, when the scolding
> winds</span>  
> <span id="1.3.6">Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen</span>  
> <span id="1.3.7">The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.8">To be exalted with the threatening clouds:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.9">But never till to-night, never till now,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.10">Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.11">Either there is a civil strife in heaven,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.12">Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.13">Incenses them to send destruction.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**CICERO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.14">Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.15">A common slave--you know him well by
> sight--</span>  
> <span id="1.3.16">Held up his left hand, which did flame and
> burn</span>  
> <span id="1.3.17">Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his
> hand,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.18">Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.19">Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--</span>  
> <span id="1.3.20">Against the Capitol I met a lion,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.21">Who glared upon me, and went surly by,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.22">Without annoying me: and there were drawn</span>  
> <span id="1.3.23">Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.24">Transformed with their fear; who swore they
> saw</span>  
> <span id="1.3.25">Men all in fire walk up and down the
> streets.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.26">And yesterday the bird of night did sit</span>  
> <span id="1.3.27">Even at noon-day upon the market-place,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.28">Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies</span>  
> <span id="1.3.29">Do so conjointly meet, let not men say</span>  
> <span id="1.3.30">'These are their reasons; they are
> natural;'</span>  
> <span id="1.3.31">For, I believe, they are portentous things</span>  
> <span id="1.3.32">Unto the climate that they point upon.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**CICERO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.33">Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.34">But men may construe things after their
> fashion,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.35">Clean from the purpose of the things
> themselves.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.36">Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.37">He doth; for he did bid Antonius</span>  
> <span id="1.3.38">Send word to you he would be there
> to-morrow.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**CICERO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.39">Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky</span>  
> <span id="1.3.40">Is not to walk in.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.41">Farewell, Cicero.</span>  
>
> *Exit CICERO*
>
> *Enter CASSIUS*

<span id="speech9">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.42">Who's there?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.43">A Roman.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.44">Casca, by your voice.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.45">Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is
> this!</span>  

<span id="speech13">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.46">A very pleasing night to honest men.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.47">Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</span>  

<span id="speech15">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.48">Those that have known the earth so full of
> faults.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.49">For my part, I have walk'd about the
> streets,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.50">Submitting me unto the perilous night,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.51">And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.52">Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.53">And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to
> open</span>  
> <span id="1.3.54">The breast of heaven, I did present myself</span>  
> <span id="1.3.55">Even in the aim and very flash of it.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.56">But wherefore did you so much tempt the
> heavens?</span>  
> <span id="1.3.57">It is the part of men to fear and tremble,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.58">When the most mighty gods by tokens send</span>  
> <span id="1.3.59">Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.60">You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of
> life</span>  
> <span id="1.3.61">That should be in a Roman you do want,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.62">Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze</span>  
> <span id="1.3.63">And put on fear and cast yourself in
> wonder,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.64">To see the strange impatience of the
> heavens:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.65">But if you would consider the true cause</span>  
> <span id="1.3.66">Why all these fires, why all these gliding
> ghosts,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.67">Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.68">Why old men fool and children calculate,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.69">Why all these things change from their
> ordinance</span>  
> <span id="1.3.70">Their natures and preformed faculties</span>  
> <span id="1.3.71">To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find</span>  
> <span id="1.3.72">That heaven hath infused them with these
> spirits,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.73">To make them instruments of fear and
> warning</span>  
> <span id="1.3.74">Unto some monstrous state.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.75">Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man</span>  
> <span id="1.3.76">Most like this dreadful night,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.77">That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and
> roars</span>  
> <span id="1.3.78">As doth the lion in the Capitol,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.79">A man no mightier than thyself or me</span>  
> <span id="1.3.80">In personal action, yet prodigious grown</span>  
> <span id="1.3.81">And fearful, as these strange eruptions
> are.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.82">'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not,
> Cassius?</span>  

<span id="speech19">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.83">Let it be who it is: for Romans now</span>  
> <span id="1.3.84">Have thews and limbs like to their
> ancestors;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.85">But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are
> dead,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.86">And we are govern'd with our mothers'
> spirits;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.87">Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.88">Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow</span>  
> <span id="1.3.89">Mean to establish Caesar as a king;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.90">And he shall wear his crown by sea and
> land,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.91">In every place, save here in Italy.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.92">I know where I will wear this dagger then;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.93">Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.94">Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most
> strong;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.95">Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.96">Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.97">Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of
> iron,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.98">Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.99">But life, being weary of these worldly
> bars,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.100">Never lacks power to dismiss itself.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.101">If I know this, know all the world
> besides,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.102">That part of tyranny that I do bear</span>  
> <span id="1.3.103">I can shake off at pleasure.</span>  
>
> *Thunder still*

<span id="speech22">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.104">So can I:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.105">So every bondman in his own hand bears</span>  
> <span id="1.3.106">The power to cancel his captivity.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.107">And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?</span>  
> <span id="1.3.108">Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.109">But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.110">He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.111">Those that with haste will make a mighty
> fire</span>  
> <span id="1.3.112">Begin it with weak straws: what trash is
> Rome,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.113">What rubbish and what offal, when it
> serves</span>  
> <span id="1.3.114">For the base matter to illuminate</span>  
> <span id="1.3.115">So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.116">Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak
> this</span>  
> <span id="1.3.117">Before a willing bondman; then I know</span>  
> <span id="1.3.118">My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.119">And dangers are to me indifferent.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.120">You speak to Casca, and to such a man</span>  
> <span id="1.3.121">That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my
> hand:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.122">Be factious for redress of all these
> griefs,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.123">And I will set this foot of mine as far</span>  
> <span id="1.3.124">As who goes farthest.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.125">There's a bargain made.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.126">Now know you, Casca, I have moved already</span>  
> <span id="1.3.127">Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans</span>  
> <span id="1.3.128">To undergo with me an enterprise</span>  
> <span id="1.3.129">Of honourable-dangerous consequence;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.130">And I do know, by this, they stay for me</span>  
> <span id="1.3.131">In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful
> night,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.132">There is no stir or walking in the
> streets;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.133">And the complexion of the element</span>  
> <span id="1.3.134">In favour's like the work we have in hand,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.135">Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.136">Stand close awhile, for here comes one in
> haste.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.137">'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.138">He is a friend.</span>  
>
> *Enter CINNA*
>
> <span id="1.3.139">Cinna, where haste you so?</span>  

<span id="speech28">**CINNA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.140">To find out you. Who's that? Metellus
> Cimber?</span>  

<span id="speech29">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.141">No, it is Casca; one incorporate</span>  
> <span id="1.3.142">To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for,
> Cinna?</span>  

<span id="speech30">**CINNA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.143">I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is
> this!</span>  
> <span id="1.3.144">There's two or three of us have seen strange
> sights.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.145">Am I not stay'd for? tell me.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**CINNA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.146">Yes, you are.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.147">O Cassius, if you could</span>  
> <span id="1.3.148">But win the noble Brutus to our party--</span>  

<span id="speech33">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.149">Be you content: good Cinna, take this
> paper,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.150">And look you lay it in the praetor's
> chair,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.151">Where Brutus may but find it; and throw
> this</span>  
> <span id="1.3.152">In at his window; set this up with wax</span>  
> <span id="1.3.153">Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.154">Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find
> us.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.155">Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?</span>  

<span id="speech34">**CINNA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.156">All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone</span>  
> <span id="1.3.157">To seek you at your house. Well, I will
> hie,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.158">And so bestow these papers as you bade me.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.159">That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.</span>  
>
> *Exit CINNA*
>
> <span id="1.3.160">Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day</span>  
> <span id="1.3.161">See Brutus at his house: three parts of
> him</span>  
> <span id="1.3.162">Is ours already, and the man entire</span>  
> <span id="1.3.163">Upon the next encounter yields him ours.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="1.3.164">O, he sits high in all the people's
> hearts:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.165">And that which would appear offence in us,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.166">His countenance, like richest alchemy,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.167">Will change to virtue and to worthiness.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.168">Him and his worth and our great need of
> him</span>  
> <span id="1.3.169">You have right well conceited. Let us go,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.170">For it is after midnight; and ere day</span>  
> <span id="1.3.171">We will awake him and be sure of him.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
