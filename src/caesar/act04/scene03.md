## SCENE III

### Brutus's tent.

> *Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS*

<span id="speech1">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.1">That you have wrong'd me doth appear in
> this:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.2">You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella</span>  
> <span id="4.3.3">For taking bribes here of the Sardians;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.4">Wherein my letters, praying on his side,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.5">Because I knew the man, were slighted off.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.6">You wronged yourself to write in such a
> case.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.7">In such a time as this it is not meet</span>  
> <span id="4.3.8">That every nice offence should bear his
> comment.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.9">Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself</span>  
> <span id="4.3.10">Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.11">To sell and mart your offices for gold</span>  
> <span id="4.3.12">To undeservers.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.13">I an itching palm!</span>  
> <span id="4.3.14">You know that you are Brutus that speak
> this,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.15">Or, by the gods, this speech were else your
> last.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.16">The name of Cassius honours this
> corruption,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.17">And chastisement doth therefore hide his
> head.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.18">Chastisement!</span>  

<span id="speech8">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.19">Remember March, the ides of March remember:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.20">Did not great Julius bleed for justice'
> sake?</span>  
> <span id="4.3.21">What villain touch'd his body, that did
> stab,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.22">And not for justice? What, shall one of us</span>  
> <span id="4.3.23">That struck the foremost man of all this
> world</span>  
> <span id="4.3.24">But for supporting robbers, shall we now</span>  
> <span id="4.3.25">Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.26">And sell the mighty space of our large
> honours</span>  
> <span id="4.3.27">For so much trash as may be grasped thus?</span>  
> <span id="4.3.28">I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.29">Than such a Roman.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.30">Brutus, bay not me;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.31">I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.32">To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.33">Older in practise, abler than yourself</span>  
> <span id="4.3.34">To make conditions.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.35">Go to; you are not, Cassius.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.36">I am.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.37">I say you are not.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.38">Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.39">Have mind upon your health, tempt me no
> further.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.40">Away, slight man!</span>  

<span id="speech15">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.41">Is't possible?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.42">Hear me, for I will speak.</span>  
> <span id="4.3.43">Must I give way and room to your rash
> choler?</span>  
> <span id="4.3.44">Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?</span>  

<span id="speech17">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.45">O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.46">All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart
> break;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.47">Go show your slaves how choleric you are,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.48">And make your bondmen tremble. Must I
> budge?</span>  
> <span id="4.3.49">Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch</span>  
> <span id="4.3.50">Under your testy humour? By the gods</span>  
> <span id="4.3.51">You shall digest the venom of your spleen,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.52">Though it do split you; for, from this day
> forth,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.53">I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my
> laughter,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.54">When you are waspish.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.55">Is it come to this?</span>  

<span id="speech20">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.56">You say you are a better soldier:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.57">Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.58">And it shall please me well: for mine own
> part,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.59">I shall be glad to learn of noble men.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.60">You wrong me every way; you wrong me,
> Brutus;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.61">I said, an elder soldier, not a better:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.62">Did I say 'better'?</span>  

<span id="speech22">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.63">If you did, I care not.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.64">When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved
> me.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.65">Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted
> him.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.66">I durst not!</span>  

<span id="speech26">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.67">No.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.68">What, durst not tempt him!</span>  

<span id="speech28">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.69">For your life you durst not!</span>  

<span id="speech29">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.70">Do not presume too much upon my love;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.71">I may do that I shall be sorry for.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.72">You have done that you should be sorry for.</span>  
> <span id="4.3.73">There is no terror, Cassius, in your
> threats,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.74">For I am arm'd so strong in honesty</span>  
> <span id="4.3.75">That they pass by me as the idle wind,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.76">Which I respect not. I did send to you</span>  
> <span id="4.3.77">For certain sums of gold, which you denied
> me:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.78">For I can raise no money by vile means:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.79">By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.80">And drop my blood for drachmas, than to
> wring</span>  
> <span id="4.3.81">From the hard hands of peasants their vile
> trash</span>  
> <span id="4.3.82">By any indirection: I did send</span>  
> <span id="4.3.83">To you for gold to pay my legions,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.84">Which you denied me: was that done like
> Cassius?</span>  
> <span id="4.3.85">Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?</span>  
> <span id="4.3.86">When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.87">To lock such rascal counters from his
> friends,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.88">Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.89">Dash him to pieces!</span>  

<span id="speech31">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.90">I denied you not.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.91">You did.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.92">I did not: he was but a fool that brought</span>  
> <span id="4.3.93">My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.94">A friend should bear his friend's
> infirmities,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.95">But Brutus makes mine greater than they
> are.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.96">I do not, till you practise them on me.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.97">You love me not.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.98">I do not like your faults.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.99">A friendly eye could never see such faults.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.100">A flatterer's would not, though they do
> appear</span>  
> <span id="4.3.101">As huge as high Olympus.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.102">Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.103">Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.104">For Cassius is aweary of the world;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.105">Hated by one he loves; braved by his
> brother;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.106">Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults
> observed,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.107">Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by
> rote,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.108">To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep</span>  
> <span id="4.3.109">My spirit from mine eyes! There is my
> dagger,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.110">And here my naked breast; within, a heart</span>  
> <span id="4.3.111">Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than
> gold:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.112">If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.113">I, that denied thee gold, will give my
> heart:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.114">Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I
> know,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.115">When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him
> better</span>  
> <span id="4.3.116">Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.117">Sheathe your dagger:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.118">Be angry when you will, it shall have
> scope;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.119">Do what you will, dishonour shall be
> humour.</span>  
> <span id="4.3.120">O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb</span>  
> <span id="4.3.121">That carries anger as the flint bears
> fire;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.122">Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.123">And straight is cold again.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.124">Hath Cassius lived</span>  
> <span id="4.3.125">To be but mirth and laughter to his
> Brutus,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.126">When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth
> him?</span>  

<span id="speech42">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.127">When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.128">Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.</span>  

<span id="speech44">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.129">And my heart too.</span>  

<span id="speech45">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.130">O Brutus!</span>  

<span id="speech46">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.131">What's the matter?</span>  

<span id="speech47">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.132">Have not you love enough to bear with me,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.133">When that rash humour which my mother gave
> me</span>  
> <span id="4.3.134">Makes me forgetful?</span>  

<span id="speech48">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.135">Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.136">When you are over-earnest with your
> Brutus,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.137">He'll think your mother chides, and leave you
> so.</span>  

<span id="speech49">**Poet**</span>

> <span id="4.3.138">\[Within\] Let me go in to see the

> <span id="4.3.139">There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not

> <span id="4.3.140">They be alone.</span>  

<span id="speech50">**LUCILIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.141">\[Within\] You shall not come to them.</span>  

<span id="speech51">**Poet**</span>

<span id="speech52">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.143">How now! what's the matter?</span>  

<span id="speech53">**Poet**</span>

> <span id="4.3.144">For shame, you generals! what do you mean?</span>  
> <span id="4.3.145">Love, and be friends, as two such men should

> <span id="4.3.146">For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than

<span id="speech54">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.147">Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!</span>  

<span id="speech55">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.148">Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow,

<span id="speech56">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.149">Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.</span>  

<span id="speech57">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.150">I'll know his humour, when he knows his

> <span id="4.3.151">What should the wars do with these jigging

> <span id="4.3.152">Companion, hence!</span>  

<span id="speech58">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.153">Away, away, be gone.</span>

> *Exit Poet*

<span id="speech59">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.154">Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders</span>

<span id="speech60">**CASSIUS**</span>

> *Exit LUCIUS*

<span id="speech62">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.159">I did not think you could have been so

<span id="speech63">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.160">O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.</span>  

<span id="speech64">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.161">Of your philosophy you make no use,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.162">If you give place to accidental evils.</span>  

<span id="speech65">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.163">No man bears sorrow better. Portia is

<span id="speech66">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.164">Ha! Portia!</span>  

<span id="speech67">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.165">She is dead.</span>  

<span id="speech68">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.166">How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you

> <span id="4.3.167">O insupportable and touching loss!</span>

<span id="speech69">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.169">Impatient of my absence,</span>

<span id="speech78">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="4.3.192">Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.</span>  

<span id="speech79">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.193">With what addition?</span>  

<span id="speech80">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="4.3.194">That by proscription and bills of

> <span id="4.3.195">Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.196">Have put to death an hundred senators.</span>  

<span id="speech81">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.197">Therein our letters do not well agree;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.198">Mine speak of seventy senators that died</span>

<span id="speech82">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.200">Cicero one!</span>  

<span id="speech83">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="4.3.201">Cicero is dead,</span>

<span id="speech84">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.204">No, Messala.</span>  

<span id="speech85">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="4.3.205">Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?</span>  

<span id="speech86">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.206">Nothing, Messala.</span>  

<span id="speech87">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="4.3.207">That, methinks, is strange.</span>  

<span id="speech88">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.208">Why ask you? hear you aught of her in

<span id="speech89">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="4.3.209">No, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech90">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.210">Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.</span>  

<span id="speech91">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="4.3.211">Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.212">For certain she is dead, and by strange

<span id="speech92">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.213">Why, farewell, Portia. We must die,
> Messala:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.214">With meditating that she must die once,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.215">I have the patience to endure it now.</span>  

<span id="speech93">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="4.3.216">Even so great men great losses should

<span id="speech94">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.217">I have as much of this in art as you,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.218">But yet my nature could not bear it so.</span>  

<span id="speech95">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.219">Well, to our work alive. What do you think</span>  
> <span id="4.3.220">Of marching to Philippi presently?</span>  

<span id="speech96">**CASSIUS**</span>

<span id="speech98">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.223">This it is:</span>
