## SCENE I

### A house in Rome.

> *ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS, seated at a table*

<span id="speech1">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="4.1.1">These many, then, shall die; their names are
> prick'd.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.2">Your brother too must die; consent you,
> Lepidus?</span>  

<span id="speech3">**LEPIDUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.3">I do consent--</span>  

<span id="speech4">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.4">Prick him down, Antony.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**LEPIDUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.5">Upon condition Publius shall not live,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.6">Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="4.1.7">He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn
> him.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.8">But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.9">Fetch the will hither, and we shall
> determine</span>  
> <span id="4.1.10">How to cut off some charge in legacies.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**LEPIDUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.11">What, shall I find you here?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.12">Or here, or at the Capitol.</span>  
>
> *Exit LEPIDUS*

<span id="speech9">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="4.1.13">This is a slight unmeritable man,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.14">Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.15">The three-fold world divided, he should
> stand</span>  
> <span id="4.1.16">One of the three to share it?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.17">So you thought him;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.18">And took his voice who should be prick'd to
> die,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.19">In our black sentence and proscription.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="4.1.20">Octavius, I have seen more days than you:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.21">And though we lay these honours on this
> man,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.22">To ease ourselves of divers slanderous
> loads,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.23">He shall but bear them as the ass bears
> gold,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.24">To groan and sweat under the business,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.25">Either led or driven, as we point the way;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.26">And having brought our treasure where we
> will,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.27">Then take we down his load, and turn him
> off,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.28">Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.29">And graze in commons.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.30">You may do your will;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.31">But he's a tried and valiant soldier.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="4.1.32">So is my horse, Octavius; and for that</span>  
> <span id="4.1.33">I do appoint him store of provender:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.34">It is a creature that I teach to fight,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.35">To wind, to stop, to run directly on,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.36">His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.37">And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.38">He must be taught and train'd and bid go
> forth;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.39">A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds</span>  
> <span id="4.1.40">On abjects, orts and imitations,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.41">Which, out of use and staled by other men,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.42">Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.43">But as a property. And now, Octavius,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.44">Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius</span>  
> <span id="4.1.45">Are levying powers: we must straight make
> head:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.46">Therefore let our alliance be combined,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.47">Our best friends made, our means stretch'd</span>  
> <span id="4.1.48">And let us presently go sit in council,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.49">How covert matters may be best disclosed,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.50">And open perils surest answered.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.51">Let us do so: for we are at the stake,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.52">And bay'd about with many enemies;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.53">And some that smile have in their hearts, I
> fear,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.54">Millions of mischiefs.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
