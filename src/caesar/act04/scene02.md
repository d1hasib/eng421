## SCENE II

### Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent.

> *Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and Soldiers; TITINIUS and
> PINDARUS meeting them*

<span id="speech1">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.1">Stand, ho!</span>  

<span id="speech2">**LUCILIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.2">Give the word, ho! and stand.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.3">What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**LUCILIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.4">He is at hand; and Pindarus is come</span>  
> <span id="4.2.5">To do you salutation from his master.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.6">He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.7">In his own change, or by ill officers,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.8">Hath given me some worthy cause to wish</span>  
> <span id="4.2.9">Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.10">I shall be satisfied.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**PINDARUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.11">I do not doubt</span>  
> <span id="4.2.12">But that my noble master will appear</span>  
> <span id="4.2.13">Such as he is, full of regard and honour.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.14">He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;</span>  
> <span id="4.2.15">How he received you, let me be resolved.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**LUCILIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.16">With courtesy and with respect enough;</span>  
> <span id="4.2.17">But not with such familiar instances,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.18">Nor with such free and friendly conference,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.19">As he hath used of old.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.20">Thou hast described</span>  
> <span id="4.2.21">A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.22">When love begins to sicken and decay,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.23">It useth an enforced ceremony.</span>  
> <span id="4.2.24">There are no tricks in plain and simple
> faith;</span>  
> <span id="4.2.25">But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.26">Make gallant show and promise of their
> mettle;</span>  
> <span id="4.2.27">But when they should endure the bloody
> spur,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.28">They fall their crests, and, like deceitful
> jades,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.29">Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**LUCILIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.30">They mean this night in Sardis to be
> quarter'd;</span>  
> <span id="4.2.31">The greater part, the horse in general,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.32">Are come with Cassius.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.33">Hark! he is arrived.</span>  
>
> *Low march within*
>
> <span id="4.2.34">March gently on to meet him.</span>  
>
> *Enter CASSIUS and his powers*

<span id="speech12">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.35">Stand, ho!</span>  

<span id="speech13">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.36">Stand, ho! Speak the word along.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**First Soldier**</span>

> <span id="4.2.37">Stand!</span>  

<span id="speech15">**Second Soldier**</span>

> <span id="4.2.38">Stand!</span>  

<span id="speech16">**Third Soldier**</span>

> <span id="4.2.39">Stand!</span>  

<span id="speech17">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.40">Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.41">Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?</span>  
> <span id="4.2.42">And, if not so, how should I wrong a
> brother?</span>  

<span id="speech19">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.43">Brutus, this sober form of yours hides
> wrongs;</span>  
> <span id="4.2.44">And when you do them--</span>  

<span id="speech20">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.45">Cassius, be content.</span>  
> <span id="4.2.46">Speak your griefs softly: I do know you
> well.</span>  
> <span id="4.2.47">Before the eyes of both our armies here,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.48">Which should perceive nothing but love from
> us,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.49">Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;</span>  
> <span id="4.2.50">Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your
> griefs,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.51">And I will give you audience.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.52">Pindarus,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.53">Bid our commanders lead their charges off</span>  
> <span id="4.2.54">A little from this ground.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.55">Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man</span>  
> <span id="4.2.56">Come to our tent till we have done our
> conference.</span>  
> <span id="4.2.57">Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
