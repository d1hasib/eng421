## SCENE I

### Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.

> *Enter BRUTUS*

<span id="speech1">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.1">What, Lucius, ho!</span>  
> <span id="2.1.2">I cannot, by the progress of the stars,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.3">Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!</span>  
> <span id="2.1.4">I would it were my fault to sleep so
> soundly.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.5">When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what,
> Lucius!</span>  
>
> *Enter LUCIUS*

<span id="speech2">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.6">Call'd you, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech3">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.7">Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.8">When it is lighted, come and call me here.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.9">I will, my lord.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech5">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.10">It must be by his death: and for my part,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.11">I know no personal cause to spurn at him,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.12">But for the general. He would be crown'd:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.13">How that might change his nature, there's the
> question.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.14">It is the bright day that brings forth the
> adder;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.15">And that craves wary walking. Crown
> him?--that;--</span>  
> <span id="2.1.16">And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.17">That at his will he may do danger with.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.18">The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</span>  
> <span id="2.1.19">Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of
> Caesar,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.20">I have not known when his affections sway'd</span>  
> <span id="2.1.21">More than his reason. But 'tis a common
> proof,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.22">That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.23">Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.24">But when he once attains the upmost round.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.25">He then unto the ladder turns his back,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.26">Looks in the clouds, scorning the base
> degrees</span>  
> <span id="2.1.27">By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.28">Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the
> quarrel</span>  
> <span id="2.1.29">Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.30">Fashion it thus; that what he is,
> augmented,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.31">Would run to these and these extremities:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.32">And therefore think him as a serpent's egg</span>  
> <span id="2.1.33">Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow
> mischievous,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.34">And kill him in the shell.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter LUCIUS*

<span id="speech6">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.35">The taper burneth in your closet, sir.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.36">Searching the window for a flint, I found</span>  
> <span id="2.1.37">This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.38">It did not lie there when I went to bed.</span>  
>
> *Gives him the letter*

<span id="speech7">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.39">Get you to bed again; it is not day.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.40">Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.41">I know not, sir.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.42">Look in the calendar, and bring me word.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.43">I will, sir.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech11">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.44">The exhalations whizzing in the air</span>  
> <span id="2.1.45">Give so much light that I may read by them.</span>  
>
> *Opens the letter and reads*
>
> <span id="2.1.46">'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see
> thyself.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.47">Shall Rome, & c. Speak, strike, redress!</span>  
> <span id="2.1.48">Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'</span>  
> <span id="2.1.49">Such instigations have been often dropp'd</span>  
> <span id="2.1.50">Where I have took them up.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.51">'Shall Rome, & c.' Thus must I piece it
> out:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.52">Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What,
> Rome?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.53">My ancestors did from the streets of Rome</span>  
> <span id="2.1.54">The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a
> king.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.55">'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated</span>  
> <span id="2.1.56">To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee
> promise:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.57">If the redress will follow, thou receivest</span>  
> <span id="2.1.58">Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!</span>  
>
> *Re-enter LUCIUS*

<span id="speech12">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.59">Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.</span>  
>
> *Knocking within*

<span id="speech13">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.60">'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.</span>  
>
> *Exit LUCIUS*
>
> <span id="2.1.61">Since Cassius first did whet me against
> Caesar,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.62">I have not slept.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.63">Between the acting of a dreadful thing</span>  
> <span id="2.1.64">And the first motion, all the interim is</span>  
> <span id="2.1.65">Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.66">The Genius and the mortal instruments</span>  
> <span id="2.1.67">Are then in council; and the state of man,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.68">Like to a little kingdom, suffers then</span>  
> <span id="2.1.69">The nature of an insurrection.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter LUCIUS*

<span id="speech14">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.70">Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.71">Who doth desire to see you.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.72">Is he alone?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.73">No, sir, there are moe with him.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.74">Do you know them?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.75">No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their
> ears,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.76">And half their faces buried in their
> cloaks,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.77">That by no means I may discover them</span>  
> <span id="2.1.78">By any mark of favour.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.79">Let 'em enter.</span>  
>
> *Exit LUCIUS*
>
> <span id="2.1.80">They are the faction. O conspiracy,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.81">Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by
> night,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.82">When evils are most free? O, then by day</span>  
> <span id="2.1.83">Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough</span>  
> <span id="2.1.84">To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none,
> conspiracy;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.85">Hide it in smiles and affability:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.86">For if thou path, thy native semblance on,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.87">Not Erebus itself were dim enough</span>  
> <span id="2.1.88">To hide thee from prevention.</span>  
>
> *Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CINNA,
> METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS*

<span id="speech20">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.89">I think we are too bold upon your rest:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.90">Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?</span>  

<span id="speech21">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.91">I have been up this hour, awake all night.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.92">Know I these men that come along with you?</span>  

<span id="speech22">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.93">Yes, every man of them, and no man here</span>  
> <span id="2.1.94">But honours you; and every one doth wish</span>  
> <span id="2.1.95">You had but that opinion of yourself</span>  
> <span id="2.1.96">Which every noble Roman bears of you.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.97">This is Trebonius.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.98">He is welcome hither.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.99">This, Decius Brutus.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.100">He is welcome too.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.101">This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus
> Cimber.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.102">They are all welcome.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.103">What watchful cares do interpose

> <span id="2.1.104">Betwixt your eyes and night?</span>  

<span id="speech28">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.105">Shall I entreat a word?</span>  
>
> *BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper*

<span id="speech29">**DECIUS BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.106">Here lies the east: doth not the day break
> here?</span>  

<span id="speech30">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.107">No.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**CINNA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.108">O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray
> lines</span>  
> <span id="2.1.109">That fret the clouds are messengers of
> day.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.110">You shall confess that you are both
> deceived.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.111">Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.112">Which is a great way growing on the south,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.113">Weighing the youthful season of the year.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.114">Some two months hence up higher toward the
> north</span>  
> <span id="2.1.115">He first presents his fire; and the high
> east</span>  
> <span id="2.1.116">Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.117">Give me your hands all over, one by one.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.118">And let us swear our resolution.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.119">No, not an oath: if not the face of men,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.120">The sufferance of our souls, the time's
> abuse,--</span>  
> <span id="2.1.121">If these be motives weak, break off
> betimes,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.122">And every man hence to his idle bed;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.123">So let high-sighted tyranny range on,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.124">Till each man drop by lottery. But if
> these,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.125">As I am sure they do, bear fire enough</span>  
> <span id="2.1.126">To kindle cowards and to steel with valour</span>  
> <span id="2.1.127">The melting spirits of women, then,
> countrymen,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.128">What need we any spur but our own cause,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.129">To prick us to redress? what other bond</span>  
> <span id="2.1.130">Than secret Romans, that have spoke the
> word,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.131">And will not palter? and what other oath</span>  
> <span id="2.1.132">Than honesty to honesty engaged,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.133">That this shall be, or we will fall for
> it?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.134">Swear priests and cowards and men
> cautelous,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.135">Old feeble carrions and such suffering
> souls</span>  
> <span id="2.1.136">That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear</span>  
> <span id="2.1.137">Such creatures as men doubt; but do not
> stain</span>  
> <span id="2.1.138">The even virtue of our enterprise,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.139">Nor the insuppressive mettle of our
> spirits,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.140">To think that or our cause or our
> performance</span>  
> <span id="2.1.141">Did need an oath; when every drop of blood</span>  
> <span id="2.1.142">That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.143">Is guilty of a several bastardy,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.144">If he do break the smallest particle</span>  
> <span id="2.1.145">Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.146">But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.147">I think he will stand very strong with us.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.148">Let us not leave him out.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**CINNA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.149">No, by no means.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**METELLUS CIMBER**</span>

> <span id="2.1.150">O, let us have him, for his silver hairs</span>  
> <span id="2.1.151">Will purchase us a good opinion</span>  
> <span id="2.1.152">And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.153">It shall be said, his judgment ruled our
> hands;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.154">Our youths and wildness shall no whit
> appear,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.155">But all be buried in his gravity.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.156">O, name him not: let us not break with
> him;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.157">For he will never follow any thing</span>  
> <span id="2.1.158">That other men begin.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.159">Then leave him out.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**CASCA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.160">Indeed he is not fit.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**DECIUS BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.161">Shall no man else be touch'd but only
> Caesar?</span>  

<span id="speech44">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.162">Decius, well urged: I think it is not
> meet,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.163">Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.164">Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of
> him</span>  
> <span id="2.1.165">A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his
> means,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.166">If he improve them, may well stretch so
> far</span>  
> <span id="2.1.167">As to annoy us all: which to prevent,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.168">Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</span>  

<span id="speech45">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.169">Our course will seem too bloody, Caius
> Cassius,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.170">To cut the head off and then hack the
> limbs,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.171">Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.172">For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.173">Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers,
> Caius.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.174">We all stand up against the spirit of
> Caesar;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.175">And in the spirit of men there is no
> blood:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.176">O, that we then could come by Caesar's
> spirit,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.177">And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.178">Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle
> friends,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.179">Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.180">Let's carve him as a dish fit for the
> gods,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.181">Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.182">And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.183">Stir up their servants to an act of rage,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.184">And after seem to chide 'em. This shall
> make</span>  
> <span id="2.1.185">Our purpose necessary and not envious:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.186">Which so appearing to the common eyes,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.187">We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.188">And for Mark Antony, think not of him;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.189">For he can do no more than Caesar's arm</span>  
> <span id="2.1.190">When Caesar's head is off.</span>  

<span id="speech46">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.191">Yet I fear him;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.192">For in the ingrafted love he bears to
> Caesar--</span>  

<span id="speech47">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.193">Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.194">If he love Caesar, all that he can do</span>  
> <span id="2.1.195">Is to himself, take thought and die for
> Caesar:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.196">And that were much he should; for he is
> given</span>  
> <span id="2.1.197">To sports, to wildness and much company.</span>  

<span id="speech48">**TREBONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.198">There is no fear in him; let him not die;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.199">For he will live, and laugh at this

>
> *Clock strikes*

<span id="speech49">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.200">Peace! count the clock.</span>  

<span id="speech50">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.201">The clock hath stricken three.</span>  

<span id="speech51">**TREBONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.202">'Tis time to part.</span>  

<span id="speech52">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.203">But it is doubtful yet,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.204">Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or
> no;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.205">For he is superstitious grown of late,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.206">Quite from the main opinion he held once</span>  
> <span id="2.1.207">Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.208">It may be, these apparent prodigies,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.209">The unaccustom'd terror of this night,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.210">And the persuasion of his augurers,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.211">May hold him from the Capitol to-day.</span>  

<span id="speech53">**DECIUS BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.212">Never fear that: if he be so resolved,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.213">I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear</span>  
> <span id="2.1.214">That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.215">And bears with glasses, elephants with
> holes,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.216">Lions with toils and men with flatterers;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.217">But when I tell him he hates flatterers,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.218">He says he does, being then most
> flattered.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.219">Let me work;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.220">For I can give his humour the true bent,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.221">And I will bring him to the Capitol.</span>  

<span id="speech54">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.222">Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch
> him.</span>  

<span id="speech55">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.223">By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?</span>  

<span id="speech56">**CINNA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.224">Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.</span>  

<span id="speech57">**METELLUS CIMBER**</span>

> <span id="2.1.225">Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.226">Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.227">I wonder none of you have thought of him.</span>  

<span id="speech58">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.228">Now, good Metellus, go along by him:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.229">He loves me well, and I have given him
> reasons;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.230">Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.</span>  

<span id="speech59">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.231">The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you,

> <span id="2.1.232">And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all

> <span id="2.1.233">What you have said, and show yourselves true

<span id="speech60">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.241">Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,</span>

<span id="speech61">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.244">Brutus, my lord!</span>  

<span id="speech62">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.245">Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you
> now?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.246">It is not for your health thus to commit</span>  
> <span id="2.1.247">Your weak condition to the raw cold
> morning.</span>  

<span id="speech63">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.248">Nor for yours neither. You've ungently,
> Brutus,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.249">Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at
> supper,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.250">You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.251">Musing and sighing, with your arms across,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.252">And when I ask'd you what the matter was,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.253">You stared upon me with ungentle looks;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.254">I urged you further; then you scratch'd your
> head,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.255">And too impatiently stamp'd with your
> foot;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.256">Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.257">But, with an angry wafture of your hand,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.258">Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.259">Fearing to strengthen that impatience</span>  
> <span id="2.1.260">Which seem'd too much enkindled, and
> withal</span>  
> <span id="2.1.261">Hoping it was but an effect of humour,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.262">Which sometime hath his hour with every
> man.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.263">It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor
> sleep,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.264">And could it work so much upon your shape</span>  
> <span id="2.1.265">As it hath much prevail'd on your
> condition,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.266">I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my
> lord,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.267">Make me acquainted with your cause of
> grief.</span>  

<span id="speech64">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.268">I am not well in health, and that is all.</span>  

<span id="speech65">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.269">Brutus is wise, and, were he not in
> health,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.270">He would embrace the means to come by it.</span>  

<span id="speech66">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.271">Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.</span>  

<span id="speech67">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.272">Is Brutus sick? and is it physical</span>  
> <span id="2.1.273">To walk unbraced and suck up the humours</span>  
> <span id="2.1.274">Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.275">And will he steal out of his wholesome
> bed,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.276">To dare the vile contagion of the night</span>  
> <span id="2.1.277">And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air</span>  
> <span id="2.1.278">To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.279">You have some sick offence within your
> mind,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.280">Which, by the right and virtue of my
> place,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.281">I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.282">I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.283">By all your vows of love and that great
> vow</span>  
> <span id="2.1.284">Which did incorporate and make us one,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.285">That you unfold to me, yourself, your
> half,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.286">Why you are heavy, and what men to-night</span>  
> <span id="2.1.287">Have had to resort to you: for here have
> been</span>  
> <span id="2.1.288">Some six or seven, who did hide their
> faces</span>  
> <span id="2.1.289">Even from darkness.</span>  

<span id="speech68">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.290">Kneel not, gentle Portia.</span>  

<span id="speech69">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.291">I should not need, if you were gentle
> Brutus.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.292">Within the bond of marriage, tell me,
> Brutus,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.293">Is it excepted I should know no secrets</span>  
> <span id="2.1.294">That appertain to you? Am I yourself</span>  
> <span id="2.1.295">But, as it were, in sort or limitation,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.296">To keep with you at meals, comfort your
> bed,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.297">And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the
> suburbs</span>  
> <span id="2.1.298">Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.299">Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.</span>  

<span id="speech70">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.300">You are my true and honourable wife,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.301">As dear to me as are the ruddy drops</span>  
> <span id="2.1.302">That visit my sad heart</span>  

<span id="speech71">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.303">If this were true, then should I know this
> secret.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.304">I grant I am a woman; but withal</span>  
> <span id="2.1.305">A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.306">I grant I am a woman; but withal</span>  
> <span id="2.1.307">A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.308">Think you I am no stronger than my sex,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.309">Being so father'd and so husbanded?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.310">Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose
> 'em:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.311">I have made strong proof of my constancy,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.312">Giving myself a voluntary wound</span>  
> <span id="2.1.313">Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with
> patience.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.314">And not my husband's secrets?</span>  

<span id="speech72">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.315">O ye gods,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.316">Render me worthy of this noble wife!</span>  
>
> *Knocking within*
>
> <span id="2.1.317">Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in
> awhile;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.318">And by and by thy bosom shall partake</span>  
> <span id="2.1.319">The secrets of my heart.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.320">All my engagements I will construe to
> thee,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.321">All the charactery of my sad brows:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.322">Leave me with haste.</span>  
>
> *Exit PORTIA*
>
> <span id="2.1.323">Lucius, who's that knocks?</span>  
>
> *Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS*

<span id="speech73">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.324">He is a sick man that would speak with
> you.</span>  

<span id="speech74">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.325">Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.326">Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?</span>  

<span id="speech75">**LIGARIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.327">Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble
> tongue.</span>  

<span id="speech76">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.328">O, what a time have you chose out, brave
> Caius,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.329">To wear a kerchief! Would you were not
> sick!</span>  

<span id="speech77">**LIGARIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.330">I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand</span>  
> <span id="2.1.331">Any exploit worthy the name of honour.</span>  

<span id="speech78">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.332">Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.333">Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.</span>  

<span id="speech79">**LIGARIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.334">By all the gods that Romans bow before,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.335">I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!</span>  
> <span id="2.1.336">Brave son, derived from honourable loins!</span>  
> <span id="2.1.337">Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up</span>  
> <span id="2.1.338">My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.339">And I will strive with things impossible;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.340">Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?</span>  

<span id="speech80">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.341">A piece of work that will make sick men
> whole.</span>  

<span id="speech81">**LIGARIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.342">But are not some whole that we must make
> sick?</span>  

<span id="speech82">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.343">That must we also. What it is, my Caius,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.344">I shall unfold to thee, as we are going</span>  
> <span id="2.1.345">To whom it must be done.</span>  

<span id="speech83">**LIGARIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.346">Set on your foot,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.347">And with a heart new-fired I follow you,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.348">To do I know not what: but it sufficeth</span>  
> <span id="2.1.349">That Brutus leads me on.</span>  

<span id="speech84">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.350">Follow me, then.</span>
