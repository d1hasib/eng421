> *Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS*

<span id="speech1">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.4.1">I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;</span>  
> <span id="2.4.2">Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:</span>  
> <span id="2.4.3">Why dost thou stay?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.4">To know my errand, madam.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.4.5">I would have had thee there, and here again,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.6">Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do
> there.</span>  
> <span id="2.4.7">O constancy, be strong upon my side,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.8">Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and
> tongue!</span>  
> <span id="2.4.9">I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.</span>  
> <span id="2.4.10">How hard it is for women to keep counsel!</span>  
> <span id="2.4.11">Art thou here yet?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.12">Madam, what should I do?</span>  
> <span id="2.4.13">Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?</span>  
> <span id="2.4.14">And so return to you, and nothing else?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.4.15">Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look
> well,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.16">For he went sickly forth: and take good
> note</span>  
> <span id="2.4.17">What Caesar doth, what suitors press to
> him.</span>  
> <span id="2.4.18">Hark, boy! what noise is that?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.19">I hear none, madam.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.4.20">Prithee, listen well;</span>  
> <span id="2.4.21">I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.22">And the wind brings it from the Capitol.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**LUCIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.23">Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.</span>  
>
> *Enter the Soothsayer*

<span id="speech9">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.4.24">Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou
> been?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**Soothsayer**</span>

> <span id="2.4.25">At mine own house, good lady.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.4.26">What is't o'clock?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**Soothsayer**</span>

> <span id="2.4.27">About the ninth hour, lady.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.4.28">Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?</span>  

<span id="speech14">**Soothsayer**</span>

> <span id="2.4.29">Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.30">To see him pass on to the Capitol.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.4.31">Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou
> not?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**Soothsayer**</span>

> <span id="2.4.32">That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar</span>  
> <span id="2.4.33">To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.34">I shall beseech him to befriend himself.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.4.35">Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards
> him?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**Soothsayer**</span>

> <span id="2.4.36">None that I know will be, much that I fear may
> chance.</span>  
> <span id="2.4.37">Good morrow to you. Here the street is
> narrow:</span>  
> <span id="2.4.38">The throng that follows Caesar at the
> heels,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.39">Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.40">Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:</span>  
> <span id="2.4.41">I'll get me to a place more void, and there</span>  
> <span id="2.4.42">Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech19">**PORTIA**</span>

> <span id="2.4.43">I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing</span>  
> <span id="2.4.44">The heart of woman is! O Brutus,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.45">The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!</span>  
> <span id="2.4.46">Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit</span>  
> <span id="2.4.47">That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow
> faint.</span>  
> <span id="2.4.48">Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;</span>  
> <span id="2.4.49">Say I am merry: come to me again,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.50">And bring me word what he doth say to thee.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt severally*
