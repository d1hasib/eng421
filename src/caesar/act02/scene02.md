## SCENE II

### CAESAR's house.

> *Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his night-gown*

<span id="speech1">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.1">Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace
> to-night:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.2">Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried
> out,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.3">'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's
> within?</span>  
>
> *Enter a Servant*

<span id="speech2">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="2.2.4">My lord?</span>  

<span id="speech3">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.5">Go bid the priests do present sacrifice</span>  
> <span id="2.2.6">And bring me their opinions of success.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="2.2.7">I will, my lord.</span>  
>
> *Exit*
>
> *Enter CALPURNIA*

<span id="speech5">**CALPURNIA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.8">What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk
> forth?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.9">You shall not stir out of your house to-day.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.10">Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd
> me</span>  
> <span id="2.2.11">Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall
> see</span>  
> <span id="2.2.12">The face of Caesar, they are vanished.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**CALPURNIA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.13">Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.14">Yet now they fright me. There is one
> within,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.15">Besides the things that we have heard and
> seen,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.16">Recounts most horrid sights seen by the
> watch.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.17">A lioness hath whelped in the streets;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.18">And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their
> dead;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.19">Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the
> clouds,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.20">In ranks and squadrons and right form of
> war,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.21">Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.22">The noise of battle hurtled in the air,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.23">Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.24">And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the
> streets.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.25">O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.26">And I do fear them.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.27">What can be avoided</span>  
> <span id="2.2.28">Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.29">Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these
> predictions</span>  
> <span id="2.2.30">Are to the world in general as to Caesar.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**CALPURNIA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.31">When beggars die, there are no comets seen;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.32">The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of
> princes.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.33">Cowards die many times before their deaths;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.34">The valiant never taste of death but once.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.35">Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.36">It seems to me most strange that men should
> fear;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.37">Seeing that death, a necessary end,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.38">Will come when it will come.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter Servant*
>
> <span id="2.2.39">What say the augurers?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="2.2.40">They would not have you to stir forth
> to-day.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.41">Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.42">They could not find a heart within the
> beast.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.43">The gods do this in shame of cowardice:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.44">Caesar should be a beast without a heart,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.45">If he should stay at home to-day for fear.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.46">No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full
> well</span>  
> <span id="2.2.47">That Caesar is more dangerous than he:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.48">We are two lions litter'd in one day,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.49">And I the elder and more terrible:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.50">And Caesar shall go forth.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**CALPURNIA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.51">Alas, my lord,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.52">Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.53">Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear</span>  
> <span id="2.2.54">That keeps you in the house, and not your
> own.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.55">We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.56">And he shall say you are not well to-day:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.57">Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.58">Mark Antony shall say I am not well,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.59">And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.</span>  
>
> *Enter DECIUS BRUTUS*
>
> <span id="2.2.60">Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them
> so.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**DECIUS BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.61">Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy
> Caesar:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.62">I come to fetch you to the senate-house.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.63">And you are come in very happy time,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.64">To bear my greeting to the senators</span>  
> <span id="2.2.65">And tell them that I will not come to-day:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.66">Cannot, is false, and that I dare not,
> falser:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.67">I will not come to-day: tell them so,
> Decius.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**CALPURNIA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.68">Say he is sick.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.69">Shall Caesar send a lie?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.70">Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so
> far,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.71">To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.72">Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**DECIUS BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.73">Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.74">Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.75">The cause is in my will: I will not come;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.76">That is enough to satisfy the senate.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.77">But for your private satisfaction,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.78">Because I love you, I will let you know:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.79">Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.80">She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.81">Which, like a fountain with an hundred
> spouts,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.82">Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans</span>  
> <span id="2.2.83">Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in
> it:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.84">And these does she apply for warnings, and
> portents,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.85">And evils imminent; and on her knee</span>  
> <span id="2.2.86">Hath begg'd that I will stay at home
> to-day.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**DECIUS BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.87">This dream is all amiss interpreted;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.88">It was a vision fair and fortunate:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.89">Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.90">In which so many smiling Romans bathed,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.91">Signifies that from you great Rome shall
> suck</span>  
> <span id="2.2.92">Reviving blood, and that great men shall
> press</span>  
> <span id="2.2.93">For tinctures, stains, relics and
> cognizance.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.94">This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.95">And this way have you well expounded it.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**DECIUS BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.96">I have, when you have heard what I can say:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.97">And know it now: the senate have concluded</span>  
> <span id="2.2.98">To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.99">If you shall send them word you will not
> come,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.100">Their minds may change. Besides, it were a
> mock</span>  
> <span id="2.2.101">Apt to be render'd, for some one to say</span>  
> <span id="2.2.102">'Break up the senate till another time,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.103">When Caesar's wife shall meet with better
> dreams.'</span>  
> <span id="2.2.104">If Caesar hide himself, shall they not
> whisper</span>  
> <span id="2.2.105">'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.106">Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love</span>  
> <span id="2.2.107">To our proceeding bids me tell you this;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.108">And reason to my love is liable.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.109">How foolish do your fears seem now,
> Calpurnia!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.110">I am ashamed I did yield to them.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.111">Give me my robe, for I will go.</span>  
>
> *Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and
> CINNA*
>
> <span id="2.2.112">And look where Publius is come to fetch
> me.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**PUBLIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.113">Good morrow, Caesar.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.114">Welcome, Publius.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.115">What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early
> too?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.116">Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.117">Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy</span>  
> <span id="2.2.118">As that same ague which hath made you
> lean.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.119">What is 't o'clock?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.120">Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.121">I thank you for your pains and courtesy.</span>  
>
> *Enter ANTONY*
>
> <span id="2.2.122">See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.123">Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow,
> Antony.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="2.2.124">So to most noble Caesar.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.125">Bid them prepare within:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.126">I am to blame to be thus waited for.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.127">Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what,
> Trebonius!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.128">I have an hour's talk in store for you;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.129">Remember that you call on me to-day:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.130">Be near me, that I may remember you.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**TREBONIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.131">Caesar, I will:</span>  
>
> *Aside*
>
> <span id="2.2.132">and so near will I be,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.133">That your best friends shall wish I had been
> further.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**CAESAR**</span>

> <span id="2.2.134">Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with
> me;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.135">And we, like friends, will straightway go
> together.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.136">\[Aside\] That every like is not the same, O
> Caesar,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.137">The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
