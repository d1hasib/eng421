### Another part of the field.

> *Enter BRUTUS, DARDANIUS, CLITUS, STRATO, and VOLUMNIUS*

<span id="speech1">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.1">Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this
> rock.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**CLITUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.2">Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my
> lord,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.3">He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.4">Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.5">It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.</span>  
>
> *Whispers*

<span id="speech4">**CLITUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.6">What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.7">Peace then! no words.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**CLITUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.8">I'll rather kill myself.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.9">Hark thee, Dardanius.</span>  
>
> *Whispers*

<span id="speech8">**DARDANIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.10">Shall I do such a deed?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**CLITUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.11">O Dardanius!</span>  

<span id="speech10">**DARDANIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.12">O Clitus!</span>  

<span id="speech11">**CLITUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.13">What ill request did Brutus make to thee?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**DARDANIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.14">To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**CLITUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.15">Now is that noble vessel full of grief,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.16">That it runs over even at his eyes.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.17">Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**VOLUMNIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.18">What says my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.19">Why, this, Volumnius:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.20">The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me</span>  
> <span id="5.5.21">Two several times by night; at Sardis once,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.22">And, this last night, here in Philippi
> fields:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.23">I know my hour is come.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**VOLUMNIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.24">Not so, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.25">Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.26">Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it
> goes;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.27">Our enemies have beat us to the pit:</span>  
>
> *Low alarums*
>
> <span id="5.5.28">It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.29">Than tarry till they push us. Good
> Volumnius,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.30">Thou know'st that we two went to school
> together:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.31">Even for that our love of old, I prithee,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.32">Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on
> it.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**VOLUMNIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.33">That's not an office for a friend, my lord.</span>  
>
> *Alarum still*

<span id="speech20">**CLITUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.34">Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying
> here.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.35">Farewell to you; and you; and you,
> Volumnius.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.36">Strato, thou hast been all this while
> asleep;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.37">Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.38">My heart doth joy that yet in all my life</span>  
> <span id="5.5.39">I found no man but he was true to me.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.40">I shall have glory by this losing day</span>  
> <span id="5.5.41">More than Octavius and Mark Antony</span>  
> <span id="5.5.42">By this vile conquest shall attain unto.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.43">So fare you well at once; for Brutus'
> tongue</span>  
> <span id="5.5.44">Hath almost ended his life's history:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.45">Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would
> rest,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.46">That have but labour'd to attain this hour.</span>  
>
> *Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!'*

<span id="speech22">**CLITUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.47">Fly, my lord, fly.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.48">Hence! I will follow.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS*
>
> <span id="5.5.49">I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.50">Thou art a fellow of a good respect;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.51">Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in
> it:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.52">Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.53">While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?</span>  

<span id="speech24">**STRATO**</span>

> <span id="5.5.54">Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my
> lord.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.55">Farewell, good Strato.</span>  
>
> *Runs on his sword*
>
> <span id="5.5.56">Caesar, now be still:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.57">I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.</span>  
>
> *Dies*
>
> *Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA, LUCILIUS, and the
> army*

<span id="speech26">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.58">What man is that?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="5.5.59">My master's man. Strato, where is thy
> master?</span>  

<span id="speech28">**STRATO**</span>

> <span id="5.5.60">Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.61">The conquerors can but make a fire of him;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.62">For Brutus only overcame himself,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.63">And no man else hath honour by his death.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**LUCILIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.64">So Brutus should be found. I thank thee,
> Brutus,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.65">That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying
> true.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.66">All that served Brutus, I will entertain
> them.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.67">Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?</span>  

<span id="speech31">**STRATO**</span>

> <span id="5.5.68">Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.69">Do so, good Messala.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="5.5.70">How died my master, Strato?</span>  

<span id="speech34">**STRATO**</span>

> <span id="5.5.71">I held the sword, and he did run on it.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="5.5.72">Octavius, then take him to follow thee,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.73">That did the latest service to my master.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="5.5.74">This was the noblest Roman of them all:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.75">All the conspirators save only he</span>  
> <span id="5.5.76">Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.77">He only, in a general honest thought</span>  
> <span id="5.5.78">And common good to all, made one of them.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.79">His life was gentle, and the elements</span>  
> <span id="5.5.80">So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up</span>  
> <span id="5.5.81">And say to all the world 'This was a man!'</span>  

<span id="speech37">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.5.82">According to his virtue let us use him,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.83">With all respect and rites of burial.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.84">Within my tent his bones to-night shall
> lie,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.85">Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.86">So call the field to rest; and let's away,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.87">To part the glories of this happy day.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
