## SCENE III

### Another part of the field.

> *Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS*

<span id="speech1">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.1">O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!</span>  
> <span id="5.3.2">Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.3">This ensign here of mine was turning back;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.4">I slew the coward, and did take it from him.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**TITINIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.5">O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.6">Who, having some advantage on Octavius,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.7">Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to
> spoil,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.8">Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.</span>  
>
> *Enter PINDARUS*

<span id="speech3">**PINDARUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.9">Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.10">Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord</span>  
> <span id="5.3.11">Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.12">This hill is far enough. Look, look,
> Titinius;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.13">Are those my tents where I perceive the
> fire?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**TITINIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.14">They are, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.15">Titinius, if thou lovest me,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.16">Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in
> him,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.17">Till he have brought thee up to yonder
> troops,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.18">And here again; that I may rest assured</span>  
> <span id="5.3.19">Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**TITINIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.20">I will be here again, even with a thought.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech8">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.21">Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.22">My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.23">And tell me what thou notest about the
> field.</span>  
>
> *PINDARUS ascends the hill*
>
> <span id="5.3.24">This day I breathed first: time is come
> round,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.25">And where I did begin, there shall I end;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.26">My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what
> news?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**PINDARUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.27">\[Above\] O my lord!</span>  

<span id="speech10">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.28">What news?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**PINDARUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.29">\[Above\] Titinius is enclosed round about</span>  
> <span id="5.3.30">With horsemen, that make to him on the
> spur;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.31">Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on
> him.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.32">Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights
> too.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.33">He's ta'en.</span>  
>
> *Shout*
>
> <span id="5.3.34">And, hark! they shout for joy.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.35">Come down, behold no more.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.36">O, coward that I am, to live so long,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.37">To see my best friend ta'en before my face!</span>  
>
> *PINDARUS descends*
>
> <span id="5.3.38">Come hither, sirrah:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.39">In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.40">And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.41">That whatsoever I did bid thee do,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.42">Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine
> oath;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.43">Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.44">That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this
> bosom.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.45">Stand not to answer: here, take thou the
> hilts;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.46">And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.47">Guide thou the sword.</span>  
>
> *PINDARUS stabs him*
>
> <span id="5.3.48">Caesar, thou art revenged,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.49">Even with the sword that kill'd thee.</span>  
>
> *Dies*

<span id="speech13">**PINDARUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.50">So, I am free; yet would not so have been,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.51">Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.52">Far from this country Pindarus shall run,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.53">Where never Roman shall take note of him.</span>  
>
> *Exit*
>
> *Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA*

<span id="speech14">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="5.3.54">It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius</span>  
> <span id="5.3.55">Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.56">As Cassius' legions are by Antony.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**TITINIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.57">These tidings will well comfort Cassius.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="5.3.58">Where did you leave him?</span>  

<span id="speech17">**TITINIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.59">All disconsolate,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.60">With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="5.3.61">Is not that he t hat lies upon the ground?</span>  

<span id="speech19">**TITINIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.62">He lies not like the living. O my heart!</span>  

<span id="speech20">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="5.3.63">Is not that he?</span>  

<span id="speech21">**TITINIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.64">No, this was he, Messala,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.65">But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.66">As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.67">So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.68">The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.69">Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are
> done!</span>  
> <span id="5.3.70">Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="5.3.71">Mistrust of good success hath done this
> deed.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.72">O hateful error, melancholy's child,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.73">Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of
> men</span>  
> <span id="5.3.74">The things that are not? O error, soon
> conceived,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.75">Thou never comest unto a happy birth,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.76">But kill'st the mother that engender'd
> thee!</span>  

<span id="speech23">**TITINIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.77">What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?</span>  

<span id="speech24">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="5.3.78">Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet</span>  
> <span id="5.3.79">The noble Brutus, thrusting this report</span>  
> <span id="5.3.80">Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.81">For piercing steel and darts envenomed</span>  
> <span id="5.3.82">Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus</span>  
> <span id="5.3.83">As tidings of this sight.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**TITINIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.84">Hie you, Messala,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.85">And I will seek for Pindarus the while.</span>  
>
> *Exit MESSALA*
>
> <span id="5.3.86">Why didst thou send me forth, brave
> Cassius?</span>  
> <span id="5.3.87">Did I not meet thy friends? and did not
> they</span>  
> <span id="5.3.88">Put on my brows this wreath of victory,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.89">And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their
> shouts?</span>  
> <span id="5.3.90">Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!</span>  
> <span id="5.3.91">But, hold thee, take this garland on thy
> brow;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.92">Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I</span>  
> <span id="5.3.93">Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.94">And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.95">By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's
> part</span>  
> <span id="5.3.96">Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius'
> heart.</span>  
>
> *Kills himself*
>
> *Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO, STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and
> LUCILIUS*

<span id="speech26">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.97">Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="5.3.98">Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.99">Titinius' face is upward.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**CATO**</span>

> <span id="5.3.100">He is slain.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.101">O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!</span>  
> <span id="5.3.102">Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our
> swords</span>  
> <span id="5.3.103">In our own proper entrails.</span>  
>
> *Low alarums*

<span id="speech31">**CATO**</span>

> <span id="5.3.104">Brave Titinius!</span>  
> <span id="5.3.105">Look, whether he have not crown'd dead
> Cassius!</span>  

<span id="speech32">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.3.106">Are yet two Romans living such as these?</span>  
> <span id="5.3.107">The last of all the Romans, fare thee
> well!</span>  
> <span id="5.3.108">It is impossible that ever Rome</span>  
> <span id="5.3.109">Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more
> tears</span>  
> <span id="5.3.110">To this dead man than you shall see me
> pay.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.111">I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find
> time.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.112">Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his
> body:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.113">His funerals shall not be in our camp,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.114">Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.115">And come, young Cato; let us to the field.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.116">Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.117">'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere
> night</span>  
> <span id="5.3.118">We shall try fortune in a second fight.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
