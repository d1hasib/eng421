<span id="speech1">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.4.1">Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!</span>  

<span id="speech2">**CATO**</span>

> <span id="5.4.2">What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?</span>  
> <span id="5.4.3">I will proclaim my name about the field:</span>  
> <span id="5.4.4">I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!</span>  
> <span id="5.4.5">A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;</span>  
> <span id="5.4.6">I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!</span>  

<span id="speech3">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.4.7">And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;</span>  
> <span id="5.4.8">Brutus, my country's friend; know me for
> Brutus!</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech4">**LUCILIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.4.9">O young and noble Cato, art thou down?</span>  
> <span id="5.4.10">Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;</span>  
> <span id="5.4.11">And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**First Soldier**</span>

> <span id="5.4.12">Yield, or thou diest.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**LUCILIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.4.13">Only I yield to die:</span>  
> <span id="5.4.14">There is so much that thou wilt kill me
> straight;</span>  
>
> *Offering money*
>
> <span id="5.4.15">Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**First Soldier**</span>

> <span id="5.4.16">We must not. A noble prisoner!</span>  

<span id="speech8">**Second Soldier**</span>

> <span id="5.4.17">Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**First Soldier**</span>

> <span id="5.4.18">I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.</span>  
>
> *Enter ANTONY*
>
> <span id="5.4.19">Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="5.4.20">Where is he?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**LUCILIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.4.21">Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:</span>  
> <span id="5.4.22">I dare assure thee that no enemy</span>  
> <span id="5.4.23">Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:</span>  
> <span id="5.4.24">The gods defend him from so great a shame!</span>  
> <span id="5.4.25">When you do find him, or alive or dead,</span>  
> <span id="5.4.26">He will be found like Brutus, like himself.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="5.4.27">This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure
> you,</span>  
> <span id="5.4.28">A prize no less in worth: keep this man
> safe;</span>  
> <span id="5.4.29">Give him all kindness: I had rather have</span>  
> <span id="5.4.30">Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,</span>  
> <span id="5.4.31">And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;</span>  
> <span id="5.4.32">And bring us word unto Octavius' tent</span>  
> <span id="5.4.33">How every thing is chanced.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
