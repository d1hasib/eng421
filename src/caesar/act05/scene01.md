## SCENE I

### The plains of Philippi.

> *Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army*

<span id="speech1">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.1">Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.2">You said the enemy would not come down,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.3">But keep the hills and upper regions;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.4">It proves not so: their battles are at hand;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.5">They mean to warn us at Philippi here,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.6">Answering before we do demand of them.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="5.1.7">Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know</span>  
> <span id="5.1.8">Wherefore they do it: they could be content</span>  
> <span id="5.1.9">To visit other places; and come down</span>  
> <span id="5.1.10">With fearful bravery, thinking by this face</span>  
> <span id="5.1.11">To fasten in our thoughts that they have
> courage;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.12">But 'tis not so.</span>  
>
> *Enter a Messenger*

<span id="speech3">**Messenger**</span>

> <span id="5.1.13">Prepare you, generals:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.14">The enemy comes on in gallant show;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.15">Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.16">And something to be done immediately.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="5.1.17">Octavius, lead your battle softly on,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.18">Upon the left hand of the even field.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.19">Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="5.1.20">Why do you cross me in this exigent?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.21">I do not cross you; but I will do so.</span>  
>
> *March*
>
> *Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army; LUCILIUS, TITINIUS,
> MESSALA, and others*

<span id="speech8">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.22">They stand, and would have parley.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.23">Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.24">Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="5.1.25">No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.26">Make forth; the generals would have some
> words.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.27">Stir not until the signal.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.28">Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?</span>  

<span id="speech14">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.29">Not that we love words better, as you do.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.30">Good words are better than bad strokes,
> Octavius.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="5.1.31">In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good
> words:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.32">Witness the hole you made in Caesar's
> heart,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.33">Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'</span>  

<span id="speech17">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.34">Antony,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.35">The posture of your blows are yet unknown;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.36">But for your words, they rob the Hybla
> bees,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.37">And leave them honeyless.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="5.1.38">Not stingless too.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.39">O, yes, and soundless too;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.40">For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.41">And very wisely threat before you sting.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="5.1.42">Villains, you did not so, when your vile
> daggers</span>  
> <span id="5.1.43">Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.44">You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like
> hounds,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.45">And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's
> feet;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.46">Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind</span>  
> <span id="5.1.47">Struck Caesar on the neck. O you
> flatterers!</span>  

<span id="speech21">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.48">Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.49">This tongue had not offended so to-day,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.50">If Cassius might have ruled.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.51">Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us
> sweat,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.52">The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
> Look;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.53">I draw a sword against conspirators;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.54">When think you that the sword goes up
> again?</span>  
> <span id="5.1.55">Never, till Caesar's three and thirty
> wounds</span>  
> <span id="5.1.56">Be well avenged; or till another Caesar</span>  
> <span id="5.1.57">Have added slaughter to the sword of
> traitors.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.58">Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors'
> hands,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.59">Unless thou bring'st them with thee.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.60">So I hope;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.61">I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.62">O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.63">Young man, thou couldst not die more
> honourable.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.64">A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such
> honour,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.65">Join'd with a masker and a reveller!</span>  

<span id="speech27">**ANTONY**</span>

> <span id="5.1.66">Old Cassius still!</span>  

<span id="speech28">**OCTAVIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.67">Come, Antony, away!</span>  
> <span id="5.1.68">Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.69">If you dare fight to-day, come to the
> field;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.70">If not, when you have stomachs.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army*

<span id="speech29">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.71">Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim
> bark!</span>  
> <span id="5.1.72">The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.73">Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**LUCILIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.74">\[Standing forth\] My lord?</span>  
>
> *BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart*

<span id="speech32">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.75">Messala!</span>  

<span id="speech33">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="5.1.76">\[Standing forth\] What says my general?</span>  

<span id="speech34">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.77">Messala,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.78">This is my birth-day; as this very day</span>  
> <span id="5.1.79">Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand,
> Messala:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.80">Be thou my witness that against my will,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.81">As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set</span>  
> <span id="5.1.82">Upon one battle all our liberties.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.83">You know that I held Epicurus strong</span>  
> <span id="5.1.84">And his opinion: now I change my mind,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.85">And partly credit things that do presage.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.86">Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</span>  
> <span id="5.1.87">Two mighty eagles fell, and there they
> perch'd,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.88">Gorging and feeding from our soldiers'
> hands;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.89">Who to Philippi here consorted us:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.90">This morning are they fled away and gone;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.91">And in their steads do ravens, crows and
> kites,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.92">Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.93">As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem</span>  
> <span id="5.1.94">A canopy most fatal, under which</span>  
> <span id="5.1.95">Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**MESSALA**</span>

> <span id="5.1.96">Believe not so.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.97">I but believe it partly;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.98">For I am fresh of spirit and resolved</span>  
> <span id="5.1.99">To meet all perils very constantly.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.100">Even so, Lucilius.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.101">Now, most noble Brutus,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.102">The gods to-day stand friendly, that we
> may,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.103">Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!</span>  
> <span id="5.1.104">But since the affairs of men rest still
> incertain,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.105">Let's reason with the worst that may
> befall.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.106">If we do lose this battle, then is this</span>  
> <span id="5.1.107">The very last time we shall speak
> together:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.108">What are you then determined to do?</span>  

<span id="speech39">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.109">Even by the rule of that philosophy</span>  
> <span id="5.1.110">By which I did blame Cato for the death</span>  
> <span id="5.1.111">Which he did give himself, I know not how,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.112">But I do find it cowardly and vile,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.113">For fear of what might fall, so to prevent</span>  
> <span id="5.1.114">The time of life: arming myself with
> patience</span>  
> <span id="5.1.115">To stay the providence of some high powers</span>  
> <span id="5.1.116">That govern us below.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.117">Then, if we lose this battle,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.118">You are contented to be led in triumph</span>  
> <span id="5.1.119">Thorough the streets of Rome?</span>  

<span id="speech41">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.120">No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble
> Roman,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.121">That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.122">He bears too great a mind. But this same
> day</span>  
> <span id="5.1.123">Must end that work the ides of March
> begun;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.124">And whether we shall meet again I know
> not.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.125">Therefore our everlasting farewell take:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.126">For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!</span>  
> <span id="5.1.127">If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.128">If not, why then, this parting was well
> made.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**CASSIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.129">For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!</span>  
> <span id="5.1.130">If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.131">If not, 'tis true this parting was well
> made.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**BRUTUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.132">Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might
> know</span>  
> <span id="5.1.133">The end of this day's business ere it
> come!</span>  
> <span id="5.1.134">But it sufficeth that the day will end,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.135">And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
