## SCENE I

### Before PROSPERO'S cell.

> *Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA*

<span id="speech1">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="4.1.1">If I have too austerely punish'd you,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.2">Your compensation makes amends, for I</span>  
> <span id="4.1.3">Have given you here a third of mine own
> life,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.4">Or that for which I live; who once again</span>  
> <span id="4.1.5">I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations</span>  
> <span id="4.1.6">Were but my trials of thy love and thou</span>  
> <span id="4.1.7">Hast strangely stood the test here, afore
> Heaven,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.8">I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.9">Do not smile at me that I boast her off,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.10">For thou shalt find she will outstrip all
> praise</span>  
> <span id="4.1.11">And make it halt behind her.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="4.1.12">I do believe it</span>  
> <span id="4.1.13">Against an oracle.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="4.1.14">Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition</span>  
> <span id="4.1.15">Worthily purchased take my daughter: but</span>  
> <span id="4.1.16">If thou dost break her virgin-knot before</span>  
> <span id="4.1.17">All sanctimonious ceremonies may</span>  
> <span id="4.1.18">With full and holy rite be minister'd,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.19">No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let
> fall</span>  
> <span id="4.1.20">To make this contract grow: but barren
> hate,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.21">Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew</span>  
> <span id="4.1.22">The union of your bed with weeds so loathly</span>  
> <span id="4.1.23">That you shall hate it both: therefore take
> heed,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.24">As Hymen's lamps shall light you.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="4.1.25">As I hope</span>  
> <span id="4.1.26">For quiet days, fair issue and long life,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.27">With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest
> den,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.28">The most opportune place, the strong'st
> suggestion.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.29">Our worser genius can, shall never melt</span>  
> <span id="4.1.30">Mine honour into lust, to take away</span>  
> <span id="4.1.31">The edge of that day's celebration</span>  
> <span id="4.1.32">When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are
> founder'd,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.33">Or Night kept chain'd below.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="4.1.34">Fairly spoke.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.35">Sit then and talk with her; she is thine
> own.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.36">What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!</span>  
>
> *Enter ARIEL*

<span id="speech6">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="4.1.37">What would my potent master? here I am.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="4.1.38">Thou and thy meaner fellows your last
> service</span>  
> <span id="4.1.39">Did worthily perform; and I must use you</span>  
> <span id="4.1.40">In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.41">O'er whom I give thee power, here to this
> place:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.42">Incite them to quick motion; for I must</span>  
> <span id="4.1.43">Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple</span>  
> <span id="4.1.44">Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.45">And they expect it from me.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="4.1.46">Presently?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="4.1.47">Ay, with a twink.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="4.1.48">Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'</span>  
> <span id="4.1.49">And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'</span>  
> <span id="4.1.50">Each one, tripping on his toe,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.51">Will be here with mop and mow.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.52">Do you love me, master? no?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="4.1.53">Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach</span>  
> <span id="4.1.54">Till thou dost hear me call.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="4.1.55">Well, I conceive.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech13">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="4.1.56">Look thou be true; do not give dalliance</span>  
> <span id="4.1.57">Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are
> straw</span>  
> <span id="4.1.58">To the fire i' the blood: be more
> abstemious,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.59">Or else, good night your vow!</span>  

<span id="speech14">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="4.1.60">I warrant you sir;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.61">The white cold virgin snow upon my heart</span>  
> <span id="4.1.62">Abates the ardour of my liver.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="4.1.63">Well.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.64">Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.65">Rather than want a spirit: appear and
> pertly!</span>  
> <span id="4.1.66">No tongue! all eyes! be silent.</span>  
>
> *Soft music*
>
> *Enter IRIS*

<span id="speech16">**IRIS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.67">Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas</span>  
> <span id="4.1.68">Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and
> pease;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.69">Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling

> <span id="4.1.74">Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.75">Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.76">And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.77">Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the

> <span id="4.1.78">Whose watery arch and messenger am I,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.79">Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign

> <span id="4.1.80">Here on this grass-plot, in this very

> *Enter CERES*

<span id="speech17">**CERES**</span>

> <span id="4.1.83">Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er</span>  
> <span id="4.1.84">Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.85">Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers</span>

> <span id="4.1.88">My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,</span>

<span id="speech18">**IRIS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.91">A contract of true love to celebrate;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.92">And some donation freely to estate</span>

<span id="speech19">**CERES**</span>

> <span id="4.1.94">Tell me, heavenly bow,</span>

<span id="speech20">**IRIS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.100">Of her society</span>

> <span id="4.1.102">Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her

> <span id="4.1.103">Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have

<span id="speech25">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="4.1.128">This is a most majestic vision, and</span>

<span id="speech26">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="4.1.131">Spirits, which by mine art</span>

<span id="speech27">**FERDINAND**</span>

>
> *Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in

<span id="speech30">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="4.1.152">\[Aside\] I had forgot that foul

>
> <span id="4.1.156">Well done! avoid; no more!</span>  

<span id="speech31">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="4.1.157">This is strange: your father's in some

> <span id="4.1.158">That works him strongly.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="4.1.159">Never till this day</span>

<span id="speech33">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="4.1.161">You do look, my son, in a moved sort,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.162">As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.163">Our revels now are ended. These our

> <span id="4.1.168">The solemn temples, the great globe

> <span id="4.1.169">Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve</span>  
> <span id="4.1.170">And, like this insubstantial pageant

> <span id="4.1.171">Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff</span>

<span id="speech36">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="4.1.180">Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel:

<span id="speech41">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="4.1.188">I told you, sir, they were red-hot with

> <span id="4.1.189">So fun of valour that they smote the air</span>

> <span id="4.1.191">For kissing of their feet; yet always

> <span id="4.1.198">Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and
