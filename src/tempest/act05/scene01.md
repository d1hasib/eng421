## SCENE I

### Before PROSPERO'S cell.

> *Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL*

<span id="speech1">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="5.1.1">Now does my project gather to a head:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.2">My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and
> time</span>  
> <span id="5.1.3">Goes upright with his carriage. How's the
> day?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="5.1.4">On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.5">You said our work should cease.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="5.1.6">I did say so,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.7">When first I raised the tempest. Say, my
> spirit,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.8">How fares the king and's followers?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="5.1.9">Confined together</span>  
> <span id="5.1.10">In the same fashion as you gave in charge,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.11">Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.12">In the line-grove which weather-fends your
> cell;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.13">They cannot budge till your release. The
> king,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.14">His brother and yours, abide all three
> distracted</span>  
> <span id="5.1.15">And the remainder mourning over them,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.16">Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly</span>  
> <span id="5.1.17">Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord
> Gonzalo;'</span>  
> <span id="5.1.18">His tears run down his beard, like winter's
> drops</span>  
> <span id="5.1.19">From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works
> 'em</span>  
> <span id="5.1.20">That if you now beheld them, your
> affections</span>  
> <span id="5.1.21">Would become tender.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="5.1.22">Dost thou think so, spirit?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="5.1.23">Mine would, sir, were I human.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="5.1.24">And mine shall.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.25">Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a
> feeling</span>  
> <span id="5.1.26">Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.27">One of their kind, that relish all as
> sharply,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.28">Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou
> art?</span>  
> <span id="5.1.29">Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the
> quick,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.30">Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury</span>  
> <span id="5.1.31">Do I take part: the rarer action is</span>  
> <span id="5.1.32">In virtue than in vengeance: they being
> penitent,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.33">The sole drift of my purpose doth extend</span>  
> <span id="5.1.34">Not a frown further. Go release them,
> Ariel:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.35">My charms I'll break, their senses I'll
> restore,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.36">And they shall be themselves.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="5.1.37">I'll fetch them, sir.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech9">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="5.1.38">Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and
> groves,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.39">And ye that on the sands with printless
> foot</span>  
> <span id="5.1.40">Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him</span>  
> <span id="5.1.41">When he comes back; you demi-puppets that</span>  
> <span id="5.1.42">By moonshine do the green sour ringlets
> make,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.43">Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose
> pastime</span>  
> <span id="5.1.44">Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice</span>  
> <span id="5.1.45">To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.46">Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd</span>  
> <span id="5.1.47">The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous
> winds,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.48">And 'twixt the green sea and the azured
> vault</span>  
> <span id="5.1.49">Set roaring war: to the dread rattling
> thunder</span>  
> <span id="5.1.50">Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout
> oak</span>  
> <span id="5.1.51">With his own bolt; the strong-based
> promontory</span>  
> <span id="5.1.52">Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd
> up</span>  
> <span id="5.1.53">The pine and cedar: graves at my command</span>  
> <span id="5.1.54">Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em
> forth</span>  
> <span id="5.1.55">By my so potent art. But this rough magic</span>  
> <span id="5.1.56">I here abjure, and, when I have required</span>  
> <span id="5.1.57">Some heavenly music, which even now I do,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.58">To work mine end upon their senses that</span>  
> <span id="5.1.59">This airy charm is for, I'll break my
> staff,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.60">Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.61">And deeper than did ever plummet sound</span>  
> <span id="5.1.62">I'll drown my book.</span>  
>
> *Solemn music*
>
> *Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture, attended
> by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN
> and FRANCISCO they all enter the circle which PROSPERO had made, and
> there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:*
>
> <span id="5.1.63">A solemn air and the best comforter</span>  
> <span id="5.1.64">To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.65">Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There
> stand,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.66">For you are spell-stopp'd.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.67">Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.68">Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of
> thine,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.69">Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves
> apace,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.70">And as the morning steals upon the night,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.71">Melting the darkness, so their rising
> senses</span>  
> <span id="5.1.72">Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that
> mantle</span>  
> <span id="5.1.73">Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.74">My true preserver, and a loyal sir</span>  
> <span id="5.1.75">To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces</span>  
> <span id="5.1.76">Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly</span>  
> <span id="5.1.77">Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.78">Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.79">Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and
> blood,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.80">You, brother mine, that entertain'd
> ambition,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.81">Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with
> Sebastian,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.82">Whose inward pinches therefore are most
> strong,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.83">Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive
> thee,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.84">Unnatural though thou art. Their
> understanding</span>  
> <span id="5.1.85">Begins to swell, and the approaching tide</span>  
> <span id="5.1.86">Will shortly fill the reasonable shore</span>  
> <span id="5.1.87">That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of
> them</span>  
> <span id="5.1.88">That yet looks on me, or would know me
> Ariel,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.89">Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.90">I will discase me, and myself present</span>  
> <span id="5.1.91">As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.92">Thou shalt ere long be free.</span>  
>
> *ARIEL sings and helps to attire him*
>
> <span id="5.1.93">Where the bee sucks. there suck I:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.94">In a cowslip's bell I lie;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.95">There I couch when owls do cry.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.96">On the bat's back I do fly</span>  
> <span id="5.1.97">After summer merrily.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.98">Merrily, merrily shall I live now</span>  
> <span id="5.1.99">Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="5.1.100">Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss

> <span id="5.1.101">But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so,

> <span id="5.1.102">To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.103">There shalt thou find the mariners asleep</span>  
> <span id="5.1.104">Under the hatches; the master and the

> <span id="5.1.105">Being awake, enforce them to this place,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.106">And presently, I prithee.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="5.1.107">I drink the air before me, and return</span>

<span id="speech12">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="5.1.109">All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement</span>

<span id="speech13">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="5.1.112">Behold, sir king,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.113">The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.114">For more assurance that a living prince</span>

<span id="speech14">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="5.1.119">Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.120">As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse</span>

<span id="speech26">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="5.1.165">A daughter?</span>

<span id="speech27">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="5.1.170">In this last tempest. I perceive these

<span id="speech46">**Boatswain**</span>

> <span id="5.1.251">The best news is, that we have safely

<span id="speech50">**Boatswain**</span>

> <span id="5.1.261">If I did think, sir, I were well awake,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.262">I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of

> <span id="5.1.266">And more diversity of sounds, all

> <span id="5.1.267">We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;</span>

<span id="speech51">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="5.1.273">\[Aside to PROSPERO\] Was't well done?</span>  

<span id="speech52">**PROSPERO**</span>

<span id="speech53">**ALONSO**</span>

<span id="speech54">**PROSPERO**</span>

<span id="speech59">**ANTONIO**</span>
