## SCENE I

### On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise

> <span id="1.1.1">of thunder and lightning heard.</span>  
>
> *Enter a Master and a Boatswain*

<span id="speech1">**Master**</span>

> <span id="1.1.2">Boatswain!</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Boatswain**</span>

> <span id="1.1.3">Here, master: what cheer?</span>  

<span id="speech3">**Master**</span>

> <span id="1.1.4">Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't,
> yarely,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.5">or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.</span>  
>
> *Exit*
>
> *Enter Mariners*

<span id="speech4">**Boatswain**</span>

> <span id="1.1.6">Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my
> hearts!</span>  
> <span id="1.1.7">yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the</span>  
> <span id="1.1.8">master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy
> wind,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.9">if room enough!</span>  
>
> *Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others*

<span id="speech5">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.10">Good boatswain, have care. Where's the
> master?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.11">Play the men.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Boatswain**</span>

> <span id="1.1.12">I pray now, keep below.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.13">Where is the master, boatswain?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**Boatswain**</span>

> <span id="1.1.14">Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep
> your</span>  
> <span id="1.1.15">cabins: you do assist the storm.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.16">Nay, good, be patient.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**Boatswain**</span>

> <span id="1.1.17">When the sea is. Hence! What cares these
> roarers</span>  
> <span id="1.1.18">for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us
> not.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.19">Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**Boatswain**</span>

> <span id="1.1.20">None that I more love than myself. You are
> a</span>  
> <span id="1.1.21">counsellor; if you can command these elements
> to</span>  
> <span id="1.1.22">silence, and work the peace of the present, we
> will</span>  
> <span id="1.1.23">not hand a rope more; use your authority: if
> you</span>  
> <span id="1.1.24">cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and
> make</span>  
> <span id="1.1.25">yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance
> of</span>  
> <span id="1.1.26">the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts!
> Out</span>  
> <span id="1.1.27">of our way, I say.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech13">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.28">I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks
> he</span>  
> <span id="1.1.29">hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion
> is</span>  
> <span id="1.1.30">perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to
> his</span>  
> <span id="1.1.31">hanging: make the rope of his destiny our
> cable,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.32">for our own doth little advantage. If he be
> not</span>  
> <span id="1.1.33">born to be hanged, our case is miserable.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
>
> *Re-enter Boatswain*

<span id="speech14">**Boatswain**</span>

> <span id="1.1.34">Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower!
> Bring</span>  
> <span id="1.1.35">her to try with main-course.</span>  
>
> *A cry within*
>
> <span id="1.1.36">A plague upon this howling! they are louder
> than</span>  
> <span id="1.1.37">the weather or our office.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO*
>
> <span id="1.1.38">Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give
> o'er</span>  
> <span id="1.1.39">and drown? Have you a mind to sink?</span>  

<span id="speech15">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="1.1.40">A pox o' your throat, you bawling,
> blasphemous,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.41">incharitable dog!</span>  

<span id="speech16">**Boatswain**</span>

> <span id="1.1.42">Work you then.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.43">Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent
> noisemaker!</span>  
> <span id="1.1.44">We are less afraid to be drowned than thou
> art.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.45">I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship
> were</span>  
> <span id="1.1.46">no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as
> an</span>  
> <span id="1.1.47">unstanched wench.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**Boatswain**</span>

> <span id="1.1.48">Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off
> to</span>  
> <span id="1.1.49">sea again; lay her off.</span>  
>
> *Enter Mariners wet*

<span id="speech20">**Mariners**</span>

> <span id="1.1.50">All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!</span>  

<span id="speech21">**Boatswain**</span>

> <span id="1.1.51">What, must our mouths be cold?</span>  

<span id="speech22">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.52">The king and prince at prayers! let's assist
> them,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.53">For our case is as theirs.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="1.1.54">I'm out of patience.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.55">We are merely cheated of our lives by
> drunkards:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.56">This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie
> drowning</span>  
> <span id="1.1.57">The washing of ten tides!</span>  

<span id="speech25">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.58">He'll be hang'd yet,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.59">Though every drop of water swear against it</span>  
> <span id="1.1.60">And gape at widest to glut him.</span>  
>
> *A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'-- 'We split, we
> split!'--'Farewell, my wife and children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We
> split, we split, we split!'*

<span id="speech26">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.61">Let's all sink with the king.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="1.1.62">Let's take leave of him.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN*

<span id="speech28">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="1.1.63">Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for
> an</span>  
> <span id="1.1.64">acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze,
> any</span>  
> <span id="1.1.65">thing. The wills above be done! but I would
> fain</span>  
> <span id="1.1.66">die a dry death.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
