## SCENE II

### The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.

> *Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA*

<span id="speech1">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.1">If by your art, my dearest father, you have</span>  
> <span id="1.2.2">Put the wild waters in this roar, allay
> them.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.3">The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking
> pitch,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.4">But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's
> cheek,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.5">Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered</span>  
> <span id="1.2.6">With those that I saw suffer: a brave
> vessel,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.7">Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in
> her,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.8">Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock</span>  
> <span id="1.2.9">Against my very heart. Poor souls, they
> perish'd.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.10">Had I been any god of power, I would</span>  
> <span id="1.2.11">Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere</span>  
> <span id="1.2.12">It should the good ship so have swallow'd
> and</span>  
> <span id="1.2.13">The fraughting souls within her.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.14">Be collected:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.15">No more amazement: tell your piteous heart</span>  
> <span id="1.2.16">There's no harm done.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.17">O, woe the day!</span>  

<span id="speech4">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.18">No harm.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.19">I have done nothing but in care of thee,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.20">Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter,
> who</span>  
> <span id="1.2.21">Art ignorant of what thou art, nought
> knowing</span>  
> <span id="1.2.22">Of whence I am, nor that I am more better</span>  
> <span id="1.2.23">Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.24">And thy no greater father.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.25">More to know</span>  
> <span id="1.2.26">Did never meddle with my thoughts.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.27">'Tis time</span>  
> <span id="1.2.28">I should inform thee farther. Lend thy
> hand,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.29">And pluck my magic garment from me. So:</span>  
>
> *Lays down his mantle*
>
> <span id="1.2.30">Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have
> comfort.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.31">The direful spectacle of the wreck, which
> touch'd</span>  
> <span id="1.2.32">The very virtue of compassion in thee,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.33">I have with such provision in mine art</span>  
> <span id="1.2.34">So safely ordered that there is no soul--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.35">No, not so much perdition as an hair</span>  
> <span id="1.2.36">Betid to any creature in the vessel</span>  
> <span id="1.2.37">Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit
> down;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.38">For thou must now know farther.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.39">You have often</span>  
> <span id="1.2.40">Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd</span>  
> <span id="1.2.41">And left me to a bootless inquisition,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.42">Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'</span>  

<span id="speech8">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.43">The hour's now come;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.44">The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.45">Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember</span>  
> <span id="1.2.46">A time before we came unto this cell?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.47">I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast
> not</span>  
> <span id="1.2.48">Out three years old.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.49">Certainly, sir, I can.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.50">By what? by any other house or person?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.51">Of any thing the image tell me that</span>  
> <span id="1.2.52">Hath kept with thy remembrance.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.53">'Tis far off</span>  
> <span id="1.2.54">And rather like a dream than an assurance</span>  
> <span id="1.2.55">That my remembrance warrants. Had I not</span>  
> <span id="1.2.56">Four or five women once that tended me?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.57">Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is
> it</span>  
> <span id="1.2.58">That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou
> else</span>  
> <span id="1.2.59">In the dark backward and abysm of time?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.60">If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest
> here,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.61">How thou camest here thou mayst.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.62">But that I do not.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.63">Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year
> since,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.64">Thy father was the Duke of Milan and</span>  
> <span id="1.2.65">A prince of power.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.66">Sir, are not you my father?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.67">Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and</span>  
> <span id="1.2.68">She said thou wast my daughter; and thy
> father</span>  
> <span id="1.2.69">Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir</span>  
> <span id="1.2.70">And princess no worse issued.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.71">O the heavens!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.72">What foul play had we, that we came from
> thence?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.73">Or blessed was't we did?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.74">Both, both, my girl:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.75">By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved
> thence,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.76">But blessedly holp hither.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.77">O, my heart bleeds</span>  
> <span id="1.2.78">To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you
> to,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.79">Which is from my remembrance! Please you,
> farther.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.80">My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.81">I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should</span>  
> <span id="1.2.82">Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself</span>  
> <span id="1.2.83">Of all the world I loved and to him put</span>  
> <span id="1.2.84">The manage of my state; as at that time</span>  
> <span id="1.2.85">Through all the signories it was the first</span>  
> <span id="1.2.86">And Prospero the prime duke, being so
> reputed</span>  
> <span id="1.2.87">In dignity, and for the liberal arts</span>  
> <span id="1.2.88">Without a parallel; those being all my
> study,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.89">The government I cast upon my brother</span>  
> <span id="1.2.90">And to my state grew stranger, being
> transported</span>  
> <span id="1.2.91">And rapt in secret studies. Thy false
> uncle--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.92">Dost thou attend me?</span>  

<span id="speech21">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.93">Sir, most heedfully.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.94">Being once perfected how to grant suits,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.95">How to deny them, who to advance and who</span>  
> <span id="1.2.96">To trash for over-topping, new created</span>  
> <span id="1.2.97">The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed
> 'em,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.98">Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key</span>  
> <span id="1.2.99">Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the
> state</span>  
> <span id="1.2.100">To what tune pleased his ear; that now he
> was</span>  
> <span id="1.2.101">The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.102">And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st
> not.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.103">O, good sir, I do.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.104">I pray thee, mark me.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.105">I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all
> dedicated</span>  
> <span id="1.2.106">To closeness and the bettering of my mind</span>  
> <span id="1.2.107">With that which, but by being so retired,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.108">O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false
> brother</span>  
> <span id="1.2.109">Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.110">Like a good parent, did beget of him</span>  
> <span id="1.2.111">A falsehood in its contrary as great</span>  
> <span id="1.2.112">As my trust was; which had indeed no
> limit,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.113">A confidence sans bound. He being thus
> lorded,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.114">Not only with what my revenue yielded,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.115">But what my power might else exact, like
> one</span>  
> <span id="1.2.116">Who having into truth, by telling of it,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.117">Made such a sinner of his memory,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.118">To credit his own lie, he did believe</span>  
> <span id="1.2.119">He was indeed the duke; out o' the
> substitution</span>  
> <span id="1.2.120">And executing the outward face of royalty,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.121">With all prerogative: hence his ambition

> <span id="1.2.122">Dost thou hear?</span>  

<span id="speech25">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.123">Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.124">To have no screen between this part he
> play'd</span>  
> <span id="1.2.125">And him he play'd it for, he needs will be</span>  
> <span id="1.2.126">Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library</span>  
> <span id="1.2.127">Was dukedom large enough: of temporal

> <span id="1.2.128">He thinks me now incapable; confederates--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.129">So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of
> Naples</span>  
> <span id="1.2.130">To give him annual tribute, do him homage,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.131">Subject his coronet to his crown and bend</span>  
> <span id="1.2.132">The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor
> Milan!--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.133">To most ignoble stooping.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.134">O the heavens!</span>  

<span id="speech28">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.135">Mark his condition and the event; then tell

> <span id="1.2.136">If this might be a brother.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.137">I should sin</span>  
> <span id="1.2.138">To think but nobly of my grandmother:</span>

<span id="speech30">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.140">Now the condition.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.141">The King of Naples, being an enemy</span>  
> <span id="1.2.142">To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's

> <span id="1.2.143">Which was, that he, in lieu o' the

> <span id="1.2.144">Of homage and I know not how much tribute,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.145">Should presently extirpate me and mine</span>  
> <span id="1.2.146">Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan</span>  
> <span id="1.2.147">With all the honours on my brother:

> <span id="1.2.148">A treacherous army levied, one midnight</span>  
> <span id="1.2.149">Fated to the purpose did Antonio open</span>  
> <span id="1.2.150">The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of

> <span id="1.2.151">The ministers for the purpose hurried

> <span id="1.2.152">Me and thy crying self.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.153">Alack, for pity!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.154">I, not remembering how I cried out then,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.155">Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint</span>  
> <span id="1.2.156">That wrings mine eyes to't.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.157">Hear a little further</span>

> <span id="1.2.159">Which now's upon's; without the which this

> <span id="1.2.160">Were most impertinent.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.161">Wherefore did they not</span>  
> <span id="1.2.162">That hour destroy us?</span>  

<span id="speech34">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.163">Well demanded, wench:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.164">My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst
> not,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.165">So dear the love my people bore me, nor
> set</span>  
> <span id="1.2.166">A mark so bloody on the business, but</span>  
> <span id="1.2.167">With colours fairer painted their foul
> ends.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.168">In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.169">Bore us some leagues to sea; where they
> prepared</span>  
> <span id="1.2.170">A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.171">Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats</span>  
> <span id="1.2.172">Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist
> us,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.173">To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to
> sigh</span>  
> <span id="1.2.174">To the winds whose pity, sighing back
> again,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.175">Did us but loving wrong.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.176">Alack, what trouble</span>  
> <span id="1.2.177">Was I then to you!</span>  

<span id="speech36">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.178">O, a cherubim</span>  
> <span id="1.2.179">Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst
> smile.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.180">Infused with a fortitude from heaven,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.181">When I have deck'd the sea with drops full
> salt,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.182">Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in

> <span id="1.2.183">An undergoing stomach, to bear up</span>  
> <span id="1.2.184">Against what should ensue.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="1.2.185">How came we ashore?</span>  

<span id="speech38">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="1.2.186">By Providence divine.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.187">Some food we had and some fresh water that</span>  
> <span id="1.2.188">A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.189">Out of his charity, being then appointed</span>

<span id="speech39">**MIRANDA**</span>
