## SCENE II

### Another part of the island.

> *Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard*

<span id="speech1">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.1">All the infections that the sun sucks up</span>  
> <span id="2.2.2">From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make
> him</span>  
> <span id="2.2.3">By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me</span>  
> <span id="2.2.4">And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor
> pinch,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.5">Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the
> mire,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.6">Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark</span>  
> <span id="2.2.7">Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but</span>  
> <span id="2.2.8">For every trifle are they set upon me;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.9">Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at
> me</span>  
> <span id="2.2.10">And after bite me, then like hedgehogs
> which</span>  
> <span id="2.2.11">Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount</span>  
> <span id="2.2.12">Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I</span>  
> <span id="2.2.13">All wound with adders who with cloven
> tongues</span>  
> <span id="2.2.14">Do hiss me into madness.</span>  
>
> *Enter TRINCULO*
>
> <span id="2.2.15">Lo, now, lo!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.16">Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment
> me</span>  
> <span id="2.2.17">For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall
> flat;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.18">Perchance he will not mind me.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.19">Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off</span>  
> <span id="2.2.20">any weather at all, and another storm
> brewing;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.21">I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black</span>  
> <span id="2.2.22">cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul</span>  
> <span id="2.2.23">bombard that would shed his liquor. If it</span>  
> <span id="2.2.24">should thunder as it did before, I know not</span>  
> <span id="2.2.25">where to hide my head: yond same cloud
> cannot</span>  
> <span id="2.2.26">choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we</span>  
> <span id="2.2.27">here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A
> fish:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.28">he smells like a fish; a very ancient and
> fish-</span>  
> <span id="2.2.29">like smell; a kind of not of the newest
> Poor-</span>  
> <span id="2.2.30">John. A strange fish! Were I in England
> now,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.31">as once I was, and had but this fish
> painted,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.32">not a holiday fool there but would give a
> piece</span>  
> <span id="2.2.33">of silver: there would this monster make a</span>  
> <span id="2.2.34">man; any strange beast there makes a man:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.35">when they will not give a doit to relieve a
> lame</span>  
> <span id="2.2.36">beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a
> dead</span>  
> <span id="2.2.37">Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like</span>  
> <span id="2.2.38">arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose</span>  
> <span id="2.2.39">my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no
> fish,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.40">but an islander, that hath lately suffered by
> a</span>  
> <span id="2.2.41">thunderbolt.</span>  
>
> *Thunder*
>
> <span id="2.2.42">Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is
> to</span>  
> <span id="2.2.43">creep under his gaberdine; there is no
> other</span>  
> <span id="2.2.44">shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man
> with</span>  
> <span id="2.2.45">strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till
> the</span>  
> <span id="2.2.46">dregs of the storm be past.</span>

> *Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand*

<span id="speech3">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.47">I shall no more to sea, to sea,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.48">Here shall I die ashore--</span>  
> <span id="2.2.49">This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a

> <span id="2.2.50">funeral: well, here's my comfort.</span>  
>
> *Drinks*
>
> *Sings*
>
> <span id="2.2.51">The master, the swabber, the boatswain and
> I,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.52">The gunner and his mate</span>  
> <span id="2.2.53">Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.54">But none of us cared for Kate;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.55">For she had a tongue with a tang,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.56">Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.57">She loved not the savour of tar nor of
> pitch,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.58">Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did
> itch:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.59">Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.60">This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my
> comfort.</span>  
>
> *Drinks*

<span id="speech4">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.61">Do not torment me: Oh!</span>  

<span id="speech5">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.62">What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you
> put</span>  
> <span id="2.2.63">tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha?
> I</span>  
> <span id="2.2.64">have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of
> your</span>  
> <span id="2.2.65">four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man

> <span id="2.2.66">ever went on four legs cannot make him give

> <span id="2.2.67">and it shall be said so again while

> <span id="2.2.68">breathes at's nostrils.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.69">The spirit torments me; Oh!</span>  

<span id="speech7">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.70">This is some monster of the isle with four legs,
> who</span>  
> <span id="2.2.71">hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the
> devil</span>  
> <span id="2.2.72">should he learn our language? I will give him
> some</span>  
> <span id="2.2.73">relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover

> <span id="2.2.74">and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's

> <span id="2.2.75">present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's

<span id="speech8">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.76">Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home
> faster.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.77">He's in his fit now and does not talk after
> the</span>  
> <span id="2.2.78">wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he
> have</span>  
> <span id="2.2.79">never drunk wine afore will go near to remove
> his</span>  
> <span id="2.2.80">fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I
> will</span>  
> <span id="2.2.81">not take too much for him; he shall pay for him

> <span id="2.2.82">hath him, and that soundly.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.83">Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,

<span id="speech11">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.85">Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is

> <span id="2.2.86">which will give language to you, cat: open

> <span id="2.2.87">mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell

> <span id="2.2.89">open your chaps again.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.90">I should know that voice: it should be--but he

> <span id="2.2.91">drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!</span>  

<span id="speech13">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.92">Four legs and two voices: a most delicate
> monster!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.93">His forward voice now is to speak well of
> his</span>  
> <span id="2.2.94">friend; his backward voice is to utter foul
> speeches</span>  
> <span id="2.2.95">and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle

> <span id="2.2.96">recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen!
> I</span>  
> <span id="2.2.97">will pour some in thy other mouth.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.98">Stephano!</span>  

<span id="speech15">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.99">Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This

> <span id="2.2.100">a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have

<span id="speech16">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.102">Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me

<span id="speech17">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.105">If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull

<span id="speech18">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.110">I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke.
> But</span>  
> <span id="2.2.111">art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou

<span id="speech19">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="2.2.116">Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not
