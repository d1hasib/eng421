## SCENE I

### Another part of the island.

> *Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and
> others*

<span id="speech1">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.1">Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.2">So have we all, of joy; for our escape</span>  
> <span id="2.1.3">Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe</span>  
> <span id="2.1.4">Is common; every day some sailor's wife,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.5">The masters of some merchant and the
> merchant</span>  
> <span id="2.1.6">Have just our theme of woe; but for the
> miracle,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.7">I mean our preservation, few in millions</span>  
> <span id="2.1.8">Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir,
> weigh</span>  
> <span id="2.1.9">Our sorrow with our comfort.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.10">Prithee, peace.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.11">He receives comfort like cold porridge.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.12">The visitor will not give him o'er so.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.13">Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.14">by and by it will strike.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.15">Sir,--</span>  

<span id="speech7">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.16">One: tell.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.17">When every grief is entertain'd that's
> offer'd,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.18">Comes to the entertainer--</span>  

<span id="speech9">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.19">A dollar.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.20">Dolour comes to him, indeed: you</span>  
> <span id="2.1.21">have spoken truer than you purposed.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.22">You have taken it wiselier than I meant you
> should.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.23">Therefore, my lord,--</span>  

<span id="speech13">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.24">Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his
> tongue!</span>  

<span id="speech14">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.25">I prithee, spare.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.26">Well, I have done: but yet,--</span>  

<span id="speech16">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.27">He will be talking.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.28">Which, of he or Adrian, for a good</span>  
> <span id="2.1.29">wager, first begins to crow?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.30">The old cock.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.31">The cockerel.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.32">Done. The wager?</span>  

<span id="speech21">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.33">A laughter.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.34">A match!</span>  

<span id="speech23">**ADRIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.35">Though this island seem to be desert,--</span>  

<span id="speech24">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.36">Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**ADRIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.37">Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--</span>  

<span id="speech26">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.38">Yet,--</span>  

<span id="speech27">**ADRIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.39">Yet,--</span>  

<span id="speech28">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.40">He could not miss't.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**ADRIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.41">It must needs be of subtle, tender and
> delicate</span>  
> <span id="2.1.42">temperance.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.43">Temperance was a delicate wench.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.44">Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly
> delivered.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**ADRIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.45">The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.46">As if it had lungs and rotten ones.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.47">Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.48">Here is everything advantageous to life.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.49">True; save means to live.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.50">Of that there's none, or little.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.51">How lush and lusty the grass looks! how
> green!</span>  

<span id="speech39">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.52">The ground indeed is tawny.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.53">With an eye of green in't.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.54">He misses not much.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.55">No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.56">But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed
> almost</span>  
> <span id="2.1.57">beyond credit,--</span>  

<span id="speech44">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.58">As many vouched rarities are.</span>  

<span id="speech45">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.59">That our garments, being, as they were, drenched
> in</span>  
> <span id="2.1.60">the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness
> and</span>  
> <span id="2.1.61">glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained
> with</span>  
> <span id="2.1.62">salt water.</span>  

<span id="speech46">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.63">If but one of his pockets could speak, would it
> not</span>  
> <span id="2.1.64">say he lies?</span>  

<span id="speech47">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.65">Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report</span>  

<span id="speech48">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.66">Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
> we</span>  
> <span id="2.1.67">put them on first in Afric, at the marriage
> of</span>  
> <span id="2.1.68">the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of
> Tunis.</span>  

<span id="speech49">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.69">'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our
> return.</span>  

<span id="speech50">**ADRIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.70">Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon
> to</span>  
> <span id="2.1.71">their queen.</span>  

<span id="speech51">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.72">Not since widow Dido's time.</span>  

<span id="speech52">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.73">Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow
> in?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.74">widow Dido!</span>  

<span id="speech53">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.75">What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good
> Lord,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.76">how you take it!</span>  

<span id="speech54">**ADRIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.77">'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of
> that:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.78">she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.</span>  

<span id="speech55">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.79">This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.</span>  

<span id="speech56">**ADRIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.80">Carthage?</span>  

<span id="speech57">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.81">I assure you, Carthage.</span>  

<span id="speech58">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.82">His word is more than the miraculous harp; he
> hath</span>  
> <span id="2.1.83">raised the wall and houses too.</span>  

<span id="speech59">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.84">What impossible matter will he make easy
> next?</span>  

<span id="speech60">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.85">I think he will carry this island home in his
> pocket</span>  
> <span id="2.1.86">and give it his son for an apple.</span>  

<span id="speech61">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.87">And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea,
> bring</span>  
> <span id="2.1.88">forth more islands.</span>  

<span id="speech62">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.89">Ay.</span>  

<span id="speech63">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.90">Why, in good time.</span>  

<span id="speech64">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.91">Sir, we were talking that our garments seem
> now</span>  
> <span id="2.1.92">as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the
> marriage</span>  
> <span id="2.1.93">of your daughter, who is now queen.</span>  

<span id="speech65">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.94">And the rarest that e'er came there.</span>  

<span id="speech66">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.95">Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.</span>  

<span id="speech67">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.96">O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.</span>  

<span id="speech68">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.97">Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day
> I</span>  
> <span id="2.1.98">wore it? I mean, in a sort.</span>  

<span id="speech69">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.99">That sort was well fished for.</span>  

<span id="speech70">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.100">When I wore it at your daughter's
> marriage?</span>  

<span id="speech71">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.101">You cram these words into mine ears
> against</span>  
> <span id="2.1.102">The stomach of my sense. Would I had never</span>  
> <span id="2.1.103">Married my daughter there! for, coming
> thence,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.104">My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.105">Who is so far from Italy removed</span>  
> <span id="2.1.106">I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine
> heir</span>  
> <span id="2.1.107">Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish</span>  
> <span id="2.1.108">Hath made his meal on thee?</span>  

<span id="speech72">**FRANCISCO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.109">Sir, he may live:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.110">I saw him beat the surges under him,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.111">And ride upon their backs; he trod the
> water,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.112">Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted</span>  
> <span id="2.1.113">The surge most swoln that met him; his bold
> head</span>  
> <span id="2.1.114">'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and
> oar'd</span>  
> <span id="2.1.115">Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke</span>  
> <span id="2.1.116">To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis
> bow'd,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.117">As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt</span>  
> <span id="2.1.118">He came alive to land.</span>  

<span id="speech73">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.119">No, no, he's gone.</span>  

<span id="speech74">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.120">Sir, you may thank yourself for this great
> loss,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.121">That would not bless our Europe with your
> daughter,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.122">But rather lose her to an African;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.123">Where she at least is banish'd from your
> eye,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.124">Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.</span>  

<span id="speech75">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.125">Prithee, peace.</span>  

<span id="speech76">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.126">You were kneel'd to and importuned
> otherwise</span>  
> <span id="2.1.127">By all of us, and the fair soul herself</span>  
> <span id="2.1.128">Weigh'd between loathness and obedience,
> at</span>  
> <span id="2.1.129">Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost
> your</span>  
> <span id="2.1.130">son,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.131">I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have</span>  
> <span id="2.1.132">More widows in them of this business'
> making</span>  
> <span id="2.1.133">Than we bring men to comfort them:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.134">The fault's your own.</span>  

<span id="speech77">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.135">So is the dear'st o' the loss.</span>  

<span id="speech78">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.136">My lord Sebastian,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.137">The truth you speak doth lack some
> gentleness</span>  
> <span id="2.1.138">And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.139">When you should bring the plaster.</span>  

<span id="speech79">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.140">Very well.</span>  

<span id="speech80">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.141">And most chirurgeonly.</span>  

<span id="speech81">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.142">It is foul weather in us all, good sir,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.143">When you are cloudy.</span>  

<span id="speech82">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.144">Foul weather?</span>  

<span id="speech83">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.145">Very foul.</span>  

<span id="speech84">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.146">Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--</span>  

<span id="speech85">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.147">He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.</span>  

<span id="speech86">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.148">Or docks, or mallows.</span>  

<span id="speech87">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.149">And were the king on't, what would I do?</span>  

<span id="speech88">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.150">'Scape being drunk for want of wine.</span>  

<span id="speech89">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.151">I' the commonwealth I would by contraries</span>  
> <span id="2.1.152">Execute all things; for no kind of traffic</span>  
> <span id="2.1.153">Would I admit; no name of magistrate;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.154">Letters should not be known; riches,
> poverty,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.155">And use of service, none; contract,

> <span id="2.1.156">Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard,

> <span id="2.1.157">No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.158">No occupation; all men idle, all;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.159">And women too, but innocent and pure;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.160">No sovereignty;--</span>  

<span id="speech90">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.161">Yet he would be king on't.</span>  

<span id="speech91">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.162">The latter end of his commonwealth forgets

<span id="speech92">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.164">All things in common nature should produce</span>

> <span id="2.1.166">Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any

> <span id="2.1.171">None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.</span>  

<span id="speech95">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.172">I would with such perfection govern, sir,</span>

<span id="speech100">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.178">I do well believe your highness; and</span>

<span id="speech106">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

<span id="speech109">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.196">Go sleep, and hear us.</span>

> *All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO*

<span id="speech110">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.197">What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes</span>  
> <span id="2.1.198">Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I

> <span id="2.1.200">Please you, sir,</span>

<span id="speech118">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.221">What, art thou waking?</span>  

<span id="speech119">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.222">Do you not hear me speak?</span>  

<span id="speech120">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.223">I do; and surely</span>

> <span id="2.1.225">Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst

> <span id="2.1.226">This is a strange repose, to be asleep</span>  
> <span id="2.1.227">With eyes wide open; standing, speaking,

> <span id="2.1.228">And yet so fast asleep.</span>  

<span id="speech121">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.229">Noble Sebastian,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.230">Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather;

<span id="speech122">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.232">Thou dost snore distinctly;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.233">There's meaning in thy snores.</span>  

<span id="speech123">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.234">I am more serious than my custom: you</span>  
> <span id="2.1.235">Must be so too, if heed me; which to do</span>  
> <span id="2.1.236">Trebles thee o'er.</span>  

<span id="speech124">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.237">Well, I am standing water.</span>  

<span id="speech125">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.238">I'll teach you how to flow.</span>  

<span id="speech126">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.239">Do so: to ebb</span>  
> <span id="2.1.240">Hereditary sloth instructs me.</span>  

<span id="speech127">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.241">O,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.242">If you but knew how you the purpose

> <span id="2.1.243">Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping

> <span id="2.1.244">You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.245">Most often do so near the bottom run</span>

<span id="speech128">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.247">Prithee, say on:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.248">The setting of thine eye and cheek

> <span id="2.1.249">A matter from thee, and a birth indeed</span>  
> <span id="2.1.250">Which throes thee much to yield.</span>  

<span id="speech129">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.251">Thus, sir:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.252">Although this lord of weak remembrance,

> <span id="2.1.253">Who shall be of as little memory</span>

<span id="speech130">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.259">I have no hope</span>

<span id="speech131">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.261">O, out of that 'no hope'</span>  
> <span id="2.1.262">What great hope have you! no hope that way

> <span id="2.1.263">Another way so high a hope that even</span>  
> <span id="2.1.264">Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,</span>

> <span id="2.1.266">That Ferdinand is drown'd?</span>  

<span id="speech132">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.267">He's gone.</span>  

<span id="speech133">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.268">Then, tell me,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.269">Who's the next heir of Naples?</span>  

<span id="speech134">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.270">Claribel.</span>  

<span id="speech135">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.271">She that is queen of Tunis; she that

> <span id="2.1.272">Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from

> <span id="2.1.273">Can have no note, unless the sun were

> <span id="2.1.274">The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born

> <span id="2.1.275">Be rough and razorable; she that--from

> <span id="2.1.276">We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast

> <span id="2.1.277">And by that destiny to perform an act</span>  
> <span id="2.1.278">Whereof what's past is prologue, what to

> <span id="2.1.279">In yours and my discharge.</span>  

<span id="speech136">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.280">What stuff is this! how say you?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.281">'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of

> <span id="2.1.282">So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which

> <span id="2.1.283">There is some space.</span>  

<span id="speech137">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.284">A space whose every cubit</span>

<span id="speech138">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

<span id="speech139">**ANTONIO**</span>

<span id="speech140">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.299">I remember</span>

<span id="speech141">**ANTONIO**</span>

<span id="speech142">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.305">But, for your conscience?</span>  

<span id="speech143">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.306">Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a

<span id="speech144">**SEBASTIAN**</span>
