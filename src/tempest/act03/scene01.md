## SCENE I

### Before PROSPERO'S Cell.

> *Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log*

<span id="speech1">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="3.1.1">There be some sports are painful, and their
> labour</span>  
> <span id="3.1.2">Delight in them sets off: some kinds of
> baseness</span>  
> <span id="3.1.3">Are nobly undergone and most poor matters</span>  
> <span id="3.1.4">Point to rich ends. This my mean task</span>  
> <span id="3.1.5">Would be as heavy to me as odious, but</span>  
> <span id="3.1.6">The mistress which I serve quickens what's
> dead</span>  
> <span id="3.1.7">And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is</span>  
> <span id="3.1.8">Ten times more gentle than her father's
> crabbed,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.9">And he's composed of harshness. I must
> remove</span>  
> <span id="3.1.10">Some thousands of these logs and pile them
> up,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.11">Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress</span>  
> <span id="3.1.12">Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such
> baseness</span>  
> <span id="3.1.13">Had never like executor. I forget:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.14">But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my
> labours,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.15">Most busy lest, when I do it.</span>  
>
> *Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen*

<span id="speech2">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.16">Alas, now, pray you,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.17">Work not so hard: I would the lightning had</span>  
> <span id="3.1.18">Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to
> pile!</span>  
> <span id="3.1.19">Pray, set it down and rest you: when this
> burns,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.20">'Twill weep for having wearied you. My
> father</span>  
> <span id="3.1.21">Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.22">He's safe for these three hours.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="3.1.23">O most dear mistress,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.24">The sun will set before I shall discharge</span>  
> <span id="3.1.25">What I must strive to do.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.26">If you'll sit down,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.27">I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me
> that;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.28">I'll carry it to the pile.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="3.1.29">No, precious creature;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.30">I had rather crack my sinews, break my
> back,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.31">Than you should such dishonour undergo,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.32">While I sit lazy by.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.33">It would become me</span>  
> <span id="3.1.34">As well as it does you: and I should do it</span>  
> <span id="3.1.35">With much more ease; for my good will is to
> it,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.36">And yours it is against.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="3.1.37">Poor worm, thou art infected!</span>  
> <span id="3.1.38">This visitation shows it.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.39">You look wearily.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="3.1.40">No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with
> me</span>  
> <span id="3.1.41">When you are by at night. I do beseech
> you--</span>  
> <span id="3.1.42">Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--</span>  
> <span id="3.1.43">What is your name?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.44">Miranda.--O my father,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.45">I have broke your hest to say so!</span>  

<span id="speech11">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="3.1.46">Admired Miranda!</span>  
> <span id="3.1.47">Indeed the top of admiration! worth</span>  
> <span id="3.1.48">What's dearest to the world! Full many a
> lady</span>  
> <span id="3.1.49">I have eyed with best regard and many a
> time</span>  
> <span id="3.1.50">The harmony of their tongues hath into
> bondage</span>  
> <span id="3.1.51">Brought my too diligent ear: for several
> virtues</span>  
> <span id="3.1.52">Have I liked several women; never any</span>  
> <span id="3.1.53">With so fun soul, but some defect in her</span>  
> <span id="3.1.54">Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed</span>  
> <span id="3.1.55">And put it to the foil: but you, O you,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.56">So perfect and so peerless, are created</span>  
> <span id="3.1.57">Of every creature's best!</span>  

<span id="speech12">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.58">I do not know</span>  
> <span id="3.1.59">One of my sex; no woman's face remember,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.60">Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I
> seen</span>  
> <span id="3.1.61">More that I may call men than you, good
> friend,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.62">And my dear father: how features are
> abroad,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.63">I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.64">The jewel in my dower, I would not wish</span>  
> <span id="3.1.65">Any companion in the world but you,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.66">Nor can imagination form a shape,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.67">Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle</span>  
> <span id="3.1.68">Something too wildly and my father's
> precepts</span>  
> <span id="3.1.69">I therein do forget.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="3.1.70">I am in my condition</span>  
> <span id="3.1.71">A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.72">I would, not so!--and would no more endure</span>  
> <span id="3.1.73">This wooden slavery than to suffer</span>  
> <span id="3.1.74">The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul
> speak:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.75">The very instant that I saw you, did</span>  
> <span id="3.1.76">My heart fly to your service; there
> resides,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.77">To make me slave to it; and for your sake</span>  
> <span id="3.1.78">Am I this patient log--man.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.79">Do you love me?</span>  

<span id="speech15">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="3.1.80">O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this
> sound</span>  
> <span id="3.1.81">And crown what I profess with kind event</span>  
> <span id="3.1.82">If I speak true! if hollowly, invert</span>  
> <span id="3.1.83">What best is boded me to mischief! I</span>  
> <span id="3.1.84">Beyond all limit of what else i' the world</span>  
> <span id="3.1.85">Do love, prize, honour you.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.86">I am a fool</span>  
> <span id="3.1.87">To weep at what I am glad of.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="3.1.88">Fair encounter</span>  
> <span id="3.1.89">Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain
> grace</span>  
> <span id="3.1.90">On that which breeds between 'em!</span>  

<span id="speech18">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="3.1.91">Wherefore weep you?</span>  

<span id="speech19">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.92">At mine unworthiness that dare not offer</span>  
> <span id="3.1.93">What I desire to give, and much less take</span>  
> <span id="3.1.94">What I shall die to want. But this is
> trifling;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.95">And all the more it seeks to hide itself,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.96">The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful
> cunning!</span>  
> <span id="3.1.97">And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!</span>  
> <span id="3.1.98">I am your wife, if you will marry me;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.99">If not, I'll die your maid: to be your
> fellow</span>  
> <span id="3.1.100">You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.101">Whether you will or no.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="3.1.102">My mistress, dearest;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.103">And I thus humble ever.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.104">My husband, then?</span>  

<span id="speech22">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="3.1.105">Ay, with a heart as willing</span>  
> <span id="3.1.106">As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my
> hand.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**MIRANDA**</span>

> <span id="3.1.107">And mine, with my heart in't; and now
> farewell</span>  
> <span id="3.1.108">Till half an hour hence.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**FERDINAND**</span>

> <span id="3.1.109">A thousand thousand!</span>  
>
> *Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally*

<span id="speech25">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="3.1.110">So glad of this as they I cannot be,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.111">Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing</span>  
> <span id="3.1.112">At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.113">For yet ere supper-time must I perform</span>  
> <span id="3.1.114">Much business appertaining.</span>
