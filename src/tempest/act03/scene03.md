## SCENE III

### Another part of the island.

> *Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and
> others*

<span id="speech1">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.1">By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.2">My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed</span>  
> <span id="3.3.3">Through forth-rights and meanders! By your
> patience,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.4">I needs must rest me.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.5">Old lord, I cannot blame thee,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.6">Who am myself attach'd with weariness,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.7">To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and
> rest.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.8">Even here I will put off my hope and keep it</span>  
> <span id="3.3.9">No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd</span>  
> <span id="3.3.10">Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea
> mocks</span>  
> <span id="3.3.11">Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him
> go.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.12">\[Aside to SEBASTIAN\] I am right glad that he's
> so</span>  
> <span id="3.3.13">out of hope.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.14">Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose</span>  
> <span id="3.3.15">That you resolved to effect.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="3.3.16">\[Aside to ANTONIO\] The next advantage</span>  
> <span id="3.3.17">Will we take throughly.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.18">\[Aside to SEBASTIAN\] Let it be to-night;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.19">For, now they are oppress'd with travel,
> they</span>  
> <span id="3.3.20">Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance</span>  
> <span id="3.3.21">As when they are fresh.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="3.3.22">\[Aside to ANTONIO\] I say, to-night: no
> more.</span>  
>
> *Solemn and strange music*

<span id="speech7">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.23">What harmony is this? My good friends,
> hark!</span>  

<span id="speech8">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.24">Marvellous sweet music!</span>  
>
> *Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes,
> bringing in a banquet; they dance about it with gentle actions of
> salutation; and, inviting the King, & c. to eat, they depart*

<span id="speech9">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.25">Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were
> these?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="3.3.26">A living drollery. Now I will believe</span>  
> <span id="3.3.27">That there are unicorns, that in Arabia</span>  
> <span id="3.3.28">There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one
> phoenix</span>  
> <span id="3.3.29">At this hour reigning there.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.30">I'll believe both;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.31">And what does else want credit, come to me,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.32">And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er
> did</span>  
> <span id="3.3.33">lie,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.34">Though fools at home condemn 'em.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.35">If in Naples</span>  
> <span id="3.3.36">I should report this now, would they believe
> me?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.37">If I should say, I saw such islanders--</span>  
> <span id="3.3.38">For, certes, these are people of the
> island--</span>  
> <span id="3.3.39">Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet,
> note,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.40">Their manners are more gentle-kind than of</span>  
> <span id="3.3.41">Our human generation you shall find</span>  
> <span id="3.3.42">Many, nay, almost any.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.43">\[Aside\] Honest lord,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.44">Thou hast said well; for some of you there
> present</span>  
> <span id="3.3.45">Are worse than devils.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.46">I cannot too much muse</span>  
> <span id="3.3.47">Such shapes, such gesture and such sound,
> expressing,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.48">Although they want the use of tongue, a
> kind</span>  
> <span id="3.3.49">Of excellent dumb discourse.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.50">\[Aside\] Praise in departing.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**FRANCISCO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.51">They vanish'd strangely.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="3.3.52">No matter, since</span>  
> <span id="3.3.53">They have left their viands behind; for we have
> stomachs.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.54">Will't please you taste of what is here?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.55">Not I.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.56">Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were
> boys,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.57">Who would believe that there were
> mountaineers</span>  
> <span id="3.3.58">Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at
> 'em</span>  
> <span id="3.3.59">Wallets of flesh? or that there were such
> men</span>  
> <span id="3.3.60">Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we
> find</span>  
> <span id="3.3.61">Each putter-out of five for one will bring
> us</span>  
> <span id="3.3.62">Good warrant of.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.63">I will stand to and feed,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.64">Although my last: no matter, since I feel</span>  
> <span id="3.3.65">The best is past. Brother, my lord the
> duke,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.66">Stand to and do as we.</span>  
>
> *Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a harpy; claps his wings
> upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes*

<span id="speech21">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="3.3.67">You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.68">That hath to instrument this lower world</span>  
> <span id="3.3.69">And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea</span>  
> <span id="3.3.70">Hath caused to belch up you; and on this
> island</span>  
> <span id="3.3.71">Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men</span>  
> <span id="3.3.72">Being most unfit to live. I have made you
> mad;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.73">And even with such-like valour men hang and
> drown</span>  
> <span id="3.3.74">Their proper selves.</span>  
>
> *ALONSO, SEBASTIAN & c. draw their swords*
>
> <span id="3.3.75">You fools! I and my fellows</span>  
> <span id="3.3.76">Are ministers of Fate: the elements,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.77">Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as
> well</span>  
> <span id="3.3.78">Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at
> stabs</span>  
> <span id="3.3.79">Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish</span>  
> <span id="3.3.80">One dowle that's in my plume: my
> fellow-ministers</span>  
> <span id="3.3.81">Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.82">Your swords are now too massy for your
> strengths</span>  
> <span id="3.3.83">And will not be uplifted. But remember--</span>  
> <span id="3.3.84">For that's my business to you--that you
> three</span>  
> <span id="3.3.85">From Milan did supplant good Prospero;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.86">Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.87">Him and his innocent child: for which foul
> deed</span>  
> <span id="3.3.88">The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have</span>  
> <span id="3.3.89">Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the
> creatures,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.90">Against your peace. Thee of thy son,
> Alonso,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.91">They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.92">Lingering perdition, worse than any death</span>  
> <span id="3.3.93">Can be at once, shall step by step attend</span>  
> <span id="3.3.94">You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you
> from--</span>  
> <span id="3.3.95">Which here, in this most desolate isle, else
> falls</span>  
> <span id="3.3.96">Upon your heads--is nothing but
> heart-sorrow</span>  
> <span id="3.3.97">And a clear life ensuing.</span>  
>
> *He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music enter the Shapes again,
> and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table*

<span id="speech22">**PROSPERO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.98">Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou</span>  
> <span id="3.3.99">Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had,
> devouring:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.100">Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated</span>  
> <span id="3.3.101">In what thou hadst to say: so, with good
> life</span>  
> <span id="3.3.102">And observation strange, my meaner
> ministers</span>  
> <span id="3.3.103">Their several kinds have done. My high charms
> work</span>  
> <span id="3.3.104">And these mine enemies are all knit up</span>  
> <span id="3.3.105">In their distractions; they now are in my
> power;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.106">And in these fits I leave them, while I
> visit</span>  
> <span id="3.3.107">Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is
> drown'd,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.108">And his and mine loved darling.</span>  
>
> *Exit above*

<span id="speech23">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.109">I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand
> you</span>  
> <span id="3.3.110">In this strange stare?</span>  

<span id="speech24">**ALONSO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.111">O, it is monstrous, monstrous:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.112">Methought the billows spoke and told me of
> it;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.113">The winds did sing it to me, and the
> thunder,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.114">That deep and dreadful organ-pipe,
> pronounced</span>  
> <span id="3.3.115">The name of Prosper: it did bass my
> trespass.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.116">Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded,
> and</span>  
> <span id="3.3.117">I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet
> sounded</span>  
> <span id="3.3.118">And with him there lie mudded.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech25">**SEBASTIAN**</span>

> <span id="3.3.119">But one fiend at a time,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.120">I'll fight their legions o'er.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**ANTONIO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.121">I'll be thy second.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO*

<span id="speech27">**GONZALO**</span>

> <span id="3.3.122">All three of them are desperate: their great
> guilt,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.123">Like poison given to work a great time
> after,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.124">Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech
> you</span>  
> <span id="3.3.125">That are of suppler joints, follow them
> swiftly</span>  
> <span id="3.3.126">And hinder them from what this ecstasy</span>  
> <span id="3.3.127">May now provoke them to.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**ADRIAN**</span>

> <span id="3.3.128">Follow, I pray you.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
