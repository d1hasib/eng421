## SCENE II

### Another part of the island.

> *Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO*

<span id="speech1">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.1">Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will
> drink</span>  
> <span id="3.2.2">water; not a drop before: therefore bear up,
> and</span>  
> <span id="3.2.3">board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.4">Servant-monster! the folly of this island!
> They</span>  
> <span id="3.2.5">say there's but five upon this isle: we are
> three</span>  
> <span id="3.2.6">of them; if th' other two be brained like us,
> the</span>  
> <span id="3.2.7">state totters.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.8">Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy
> eyes</span>  
> <span id="3.2.9">are almost set in thy head.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.10">Where should they be set else? he were a
> brave</span>  
> <span id="3.2.11">monster indeed, if they were set in his
> tail.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.12">My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in
> sack:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.13">for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere
> I</span>  
> <span id="3.2.14">could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues
> off</span>  
> <span id="3.2.15">and on. By this light, thou shalt be my
> lieutenant,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.16">monster, or my standard.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.17">Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no
> standard.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.18">We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.19">Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet
> say</span>  
> <span id="3.2.20">nothing neither.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.21">Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest
> a</span>  
> <span id="3.2.22">good moon-calf.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.23">How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.24">I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.25">Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case
> to</span>  
> <span id="3.2.26">justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish
> thou,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.27">was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so
> much</span>  
> <span id="3.2.28">sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous
> lie,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.29">being but half a fish and half a monster?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.30">Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my
> lord?</span>  

<span id="speech13">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.31">'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a
> natural!</span>  

<span id="speech14">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.32">Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I
> prithee.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.33">Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if
> you</span>  
> <span id="3.2.34">prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor
> monster's</span>  
> <span id="3.2.35">my subject and he shall not suffer
> indignity.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.36">I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased
> to</span>  
> <span id="3.2.37">hearken once again to the suit I made to
> thee?</span>  

<span id="speech17">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.38">Marry, will I kneel and repeat it; I will
> stand,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.39">and so shall Trinculo.</span>  
>
> *Enter ARIEL, invisible*

<span id="speech18">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.40">As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant,
> a</span>  
> <span id="3.2.41">sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the
> island.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="3.2.42">Thou liest.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.43">Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would
> my</span>  
> <span id="3.2.44">valiant master would destroy thee! I do not
> lie.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.45">Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale,
> by</span>  
> <span id="3.2.46">this hand, I will supplant some of your
> teeth.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.47">Why, I said nothing.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.48">Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.49">I say, by sorcery he got this isle;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.50">From me he got it. if thy greatness will</span>  
> <span id="3.2.51">Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.52">But this thing dare not,--</span>  

<span id="speech25">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.53">That's most certain.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.54">Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve
> thee.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.55">How now shall this be compassed?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.56">Canst thou bring me to the party?</span>  

<span id="speech28">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.57">Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee
> asleep,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.58">Where thou mayst knock a nail into his
> bead.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="3.2.59">Thou liest; thou canst not.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.60">What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy
> patch!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.61">I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows</span>  
> <span id="3.2.62">And take his bottle from him: when that's
> gone</span>  
> <span id="3.2.63">He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show
> him</span>  
> <span id="3.2.64">Where the quick freshes are.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.65">Trinculo, run into no further danger:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.66">interrupt the monster one word further,
> and,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.67">by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o'
> doors</span>  
> <span id="3.2.68">and make a stock-fish of thee.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.69">Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go
> farther</span>  
> <span id="3.2.70">off.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.71">Didst thou not say he lied?</span>  

<span id="speech34">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="3.2.72">Thou liest.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.73">Do I so? take thou that.</span>  
>
> *Beats TRINCULO*
>
> <span id="3.2.74">As you like this, give me the lie another
> time.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.75">I did not give the lie. Out o' your</span>  
> <span id="3.2.76">wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.77">this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on</span>  
> <span id="3.2.78">your monster, and the devil take your
> fingers!</span>  

<span id="speech37">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.79">Ha, ha, ha!</span>  

<span id="speech38">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.80">Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand
> farther</span>  
> <span id="3.2.81">off.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.82">Beat him enough: after a little time</span>  
> <span id="3.2.83">I'll beat him too.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.84">Stand farther. Come, proceed.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.85">Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with
> him,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.86">I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain
> him,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.87">Having first seized his books, or with a
> log</span>  
> <span id="3.2.88">Batter his skull, or paunch him with a
> stake,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.89">Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember</span>  
> <span id="3.2.90">First to possess his books; for without
> them</span>  
> <span id="3.2.91">He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not</span>  
> <span id="3.2.92">One spirit to command: they all do hate him</span>  
> <span id="3.2.93">As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.94">He has brave utensils,--for so he calls
> them--</span>  
> <span id="3.2.95">Which when he has a house, he'll deck
> withal</span>  
> <span id="3.2.96">And that most deeply to consider is</span>  
> <span id="3.2.97">The beauty of his daughter; he himself</span>  
> <span id="3.2.98">Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.99">But only Sycorax my dam and she;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.100">But she as far surpasseth Sycorax</span>  
> <span id="3.2.101">As great'st does least.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.102">Is it so brave a lass?</span>  

<span id="speech43">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.103">Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I
> warrant.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.104">And bring thee forth brave brood.</span>  

<span id="speech44">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.105">Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and
> I</span>  
> <span id="3.2.106">will be king and queen--save our
> graces!--and</span>  
> <span id="3.2.107">Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost
> thou</span>  
> <span id="3.2.108">like the plot, Trinculo?</span>  

<span id="speech45">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.109">Excellent.</span>  

<span id="speech46">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.110">Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee;
> but,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.111">while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy
> head.</span>  

<span id="speech47">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.112">Within this half hour will he be asleep:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.113">Wilt thou destroy him then?</span>  

<span id="speech48">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.114">Ay, on mine honour.</span>  

<span id="speech49">**ARIEL**</span>

> <span id="3.2.115">This will I tell my master.</span>  

<span id="speech50">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.116">Thou makest me merry; I am full of
> pleasure:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.117">Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch</span>  
> <span id="3.2.118">You taught me but while-ere?</span>  

<span id="speech51">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.119">At thy request, monster, I will do reason,
> any</span>  
> <span id="3.2.120">reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.</span>  
>
> *Sings*
>
> <span id="3.2.121">Flout 'em and scout 'em</span>  
> <span id="3.2.122">And scout 'em and flout 'em</span>  
> <span id="3.2.123">Thought is free.</span>  

<span id="speech52">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.124">That's not the tune.</span>  
>
> *Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe*

<span id="speech53">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.125">What is this same?</span>  

<span id="speech54">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.126">This is the tune of our catch, played by the
> picture</span>  
> <span id="3.2.127">of Nobody.</span>  

<span id="speech55">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.128">If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy

> <span id="3.2.129">if thou beest a devil, take't as thou
> list.</span>  

<span id="speech56">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.130">O, forgive me my sins!</span>  

<span id="speech57">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.131">He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy

<span id="speech58">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.132">Art thou afeard?</span>  

<span id="speech59">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.133">No, monster, not I.</span>  

<span id="speech60">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.134">Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.135">Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt
> not.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.136">Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments</span>  
> <span id="3.2.137">Will hum about mine ears, and sometime
> voices</span>  
> <span id="3.2.138">That, if I then had waked after long
> sleep,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.139">Will make me sleep again: and then, in
> dreaming,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.140">The clouds methought would open and show
> riches</span>  
> <span id="3.2.141">Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.142">I cried to dream again.</span>  

<span id="speech61">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.143">This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I

> <span id="3.2.144">have my music for nothing.</span>  

<span id="speech62">**CALIBAN**</span>

> <span id="3.2.145">When Prospero is destroyed.</span>  

<span id="speech63">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.146">That shall be by and by: I remember the

<span id="speech64">**TRINCULO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.147">The sound is going away; let's follow it,

> <span id="3.2.148">after do our work.</span>  

<span id="speech65">**STEPHANO**</span>

> <span id="3.2.149">Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could

> <span id="3.2.150">this tabourer; he lays it on.</span>  

<span id="speech66">**TRINCULO**</span>
