## SCENE IV

### The court.

> *Enter KING RICHARD II, with BAGOT and GREEN at one door; and the DUKE
> OF AUMERLE at another*

<span id="speech1">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.4.1">We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.2">How far brought you high Hereford on his
> way?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="1.4.3">I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.4">But to the next highway, and there I left
> him.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.4.5">And say, what store of parting tears were
> shed?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="1.4.6">Faith, none for me; except the north-east
> wind,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.7">Which then blew bitterly against our faces,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.8">Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance</span>  
> <span id="1.4.9">Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.4.10">What said our cousin when you parted with
> him?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="1.4.11">'Farewell:'</span>  
> <span id="1.4.12">And, for my heart disdained that my tongue</span>  
> <span id="1.4.13">Should so profane the word, that taught me
> craft</span>  
> <span id="1.4.14">To counterfeit oppression of such grief</span>  
> <span id="1.4.15">That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's
> grave.</span>  
> <span id="1.4.16">Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd
> hours</span>  
> <span id="1.4.17">And added years to his short banishment,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.18">He should have had a volume of farewells;</span>  
> <span id="1.4.19">But since it would not, he had none of me.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.4.20">He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.21">When time shall call him home from
> banishment,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.22">Whether our kinsman come to see his
> friends.</span>  
> <span id="1.4.23">Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green</span>  
> <span id="1.4.24">Observed his courtship to the common
> people;</span>  
> <span id="1.4.25">How he did seem to dive into their hearts</span>  
> <span id="1.4.26">With humble and familiar courtesy,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.27">What reverence he did throw away on slaves,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.28">Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of
> smiles</span>  
> <span id="1.4.29">And patient underbearing of his fortune,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.30">As 'twere to banish their affects with him.</span>  
> <span id="1.4.31">Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;</span>  
> <span id="1.4.32">A brace of draymen bid God speed him well</span>  
> <span id="1.4.33">And had the tribute of his supple knee,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.34">With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving
> friends;'</span>  
> <span id="1.4.35">As were our England in reversion his,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.36">And he our subjects' next degree in hope.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**GREEN**</span>

> <span id="1.4.37">Well, he is gone; and with him go these
> thoughts.</span>  
> <span id="1.4.38">Now for the rebels which stand out in
> Ireland,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.39">Expedient manage must be made, my liege,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.40">Ere further leisure yield them further
> means</span>  
> <span id="1.4.41">For their advantage and your highness'
> loss.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.4.42">We will ourself in person to this war:</span>  
> <span id="1.4.43">And, for our coffers, with too great a
> court</span>  
> <span id="1.4.44">And liberal largess, are grown somewhat
> light,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.45">We are inforced to farm our royal realm;</span>  
> <span id="1.4.46">The revenue whereof shall furnish us</span>  
> <span id="1.4.47">For our affairs in hand: if that come
> short,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.48">Our substitutes at home shall have blank
> charters;</span>  
> <span id="1.4.49">Whereto, when they shall know what men are
> rich,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.50">They shall subscribe them for large sums of
> gold</span>  
> <span id="1.4.51">And send them after to supply our wants;</span>  
> <span id="1.4.52">For we will make for Ireland presently.</span>  
>
> *Enter BUSHY*
>
> <span id="1.4.53">Bushy, what news?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**BUSHY**</span>

> <span id="1.4.54">Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my
> lord,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.55">Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste</span>  
> <span id="1.4.56">To entreat your majesty to visit him.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.4.57">Where lies he?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**BUSHY**</span>

> <span id="1.4.58">At Ely House.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.4.59">Now put it, God, in the physician's mind</span>  
> <span id="1.4.60">To help him to his grave immediately!</span>  
> <span id="1.4.61">The lining of his coffers shall make coats</span>  
> <span id="1.4.62">To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.</span>  
> <span id="1.4.63">Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:</span>  
> <span id="1.4.64">Pray God we may make haste, and come too
> late!</span>  

<span id="speech14">**All**</span>

> <span id="1.4.65">Amen.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
