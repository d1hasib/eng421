## SCENE I

### London. KING RICHARD II's palace.

> *Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and
> Attendants*

<span id="speech1">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.1.1">Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.2">Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.3">Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.4">Here to make good the boisterous late
> appeal,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.5">Which then our leisure would not let us
> hear,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.6">Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="1.1.7">I have, my liege.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.1.8">Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.9">If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.10">Or worthily, as a good subject should,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.11">On some known ground of treachery in him?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="1.1.12">As near as I could sift him on that
> argument,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.13">On some apparent danger seen in him</span>  
> <span id="1.1.14">Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate
> malice.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.1.15">Then call them to our presence; face to
> face,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.16">And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will
> hear</span>  
> <span id="1.1.17">The accuser and the accused freely speak:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.18">High-stomach'd are they both, and full of
> ire,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.19">In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</span>  
>
> *Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY*

<span id="speech6">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="1.1.20">Many years of happy days befal</span>  
> <span id="1.1.21">My gracious sovereign, my most loving
> liege!</span>  

<span id="speech7">**THOMAS MOWBRAY**</span>

> <span id="1.1.22">Each day still better other's happiness;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.23">Until the heavens, envying earth's good
> hap,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.24">Add an immortal title to your crown!</span>  

<span id="speech8">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.1.25">We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.26">As well appeareth by the cause you come;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.27">Namely to appeal each other of high
> treason.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.28">Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object</span>  
> <span id="1.1.29">Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas
> Mowbray?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="1.1.30">First, heaven be the record to my speech!</span>  
> <span id="1.1.31">In the devotion of a subject's love,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.32">Tendering the precious safety of my prince,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.33">And free from other misbegotten hate,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.34">Come I appellant to this princely presence.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.35">Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.36">And mark my greeting well; for what I speak</span>  
> <span id="1.1.37">My body shall make good upon this earth,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.38">Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.39">Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.40">Too good to be so and too bad to live,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.41">Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.42">The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.43">Once more, the more to aggravate the note,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.44">With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy
> throat;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.45">And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I
> move,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.46">What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may
> prove.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**THOMAS MOWBRAY**</span>

> <span id="1.1.47">Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.48">'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.49">The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.50">Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.51">The blood is hot that must be cool'd for
> this:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.52">Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</span>  
> <span id="1.1.53">As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.54">First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs
> me</span>  
> <span id="1.1.55">From giving reins and spurs to my free
> speech;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.56">Which else would post until it had return'd</span>  
> <span id="1.1.57">These terms of treason doubled down his
> throat.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.58">Setting aside his high blood's royalty,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.59">And let him be no kinsman to my liege,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.60">I do defy him, and I spit at him;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.61">Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.62">Which to maintain I would allow him odds,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.63">And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</span>  
> <span id="1.1.64">Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.65">Or any other ground inhabitable,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.66">Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.67">Mean time let this defend my loyalty,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.68">By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="1.1.69">Pale trembling coward, there I throw my
> gage,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.70">Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.71">And lay aside my high blood's royalty,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.72">Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to
> except.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.73">If guilty dread have left thee so much
> strength</span>  
> <span id="1.1.74">As to take up mine honour's pawn, then
> stoop:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.75">By that and all the rites of knighthood
> else,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.76">Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.77">What I have spoke, or thou canst worse
> devise.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**THOMAS MOWBRAY**</span>

> <span id="1.1.78">I take it up; and by that sword I swear</span>  
> <span id="1.1.79">Which gently laid my knighthood on my
> shoulder,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.80">I'll answer thee in any fair degree,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.81">Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.82">And when I mount, alive may I not light,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.83">If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</span>  

<span id="speech13">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.1.84">What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's
> charge?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.85">It must be great that can inherit us</span>  
> <span id="1.1.86">So much as of a thought of ill in him.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="1.1.87">Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it
> true;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.88">That Mowbray hath received eight thousand
> nobles</span>  
> <span id="1.1.89">In name of lendings for your highness'
> soldiers,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.90">The which he hath detain'd for lewd
> employments,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.91">Like a false traitor and injurious villain.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.92">Besides I say and will in battle prove,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.93">Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</span>  
> <span id="1.1.94">That ever was survey'd by English eye,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.95">That all the treasons for these eighteen
> years</span>  
> <span id="1.1.96">Complotted and contrived in this land</span>  
> <span id="1.1.97">Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and
> spring.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.98">Further I say and further will maintain</span>  
> <span id="1.1.99">Upon his bad life to make all this good,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.100">That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's
> death,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.101">Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.102">And consequently, like a traitor coward,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.103">Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of
> blood:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.104">Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's,
> cries,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.105">Even from the tongueless caverns of the
> earth,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.106">To me for justice and rough chastisement;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.107">And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.108">This arm shall do it, or this life be
> spent.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.1.109">How high a pitch his resolution soars!</span>  
> <span id="1.1.110">Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to
> this?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**THOMAS MOWBRAY**</span>

> <span id="1.1.111">O, let my sovereign turn away his face</span>  
> <span id="1.1.112">And bid his ears a little while be deaf,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.113">Till I have told this slander of his
> blood,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.114">How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.1.115">Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.116">Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's
> heir,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.117">As he is but my father's brother's son,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.118">Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.119">Such neighbour nearness to our sacred
> blood</span>  
> <span id="1.1.120">Should nothing privilege him, nor
> partialize</span>  
> <span id="1.1.121">The unstooping firmness of my upright
> soul:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.122">He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.123">Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**THOMAS MOWBRAY**</span>

> <span id="1.1.124">Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.125">Through the false passage of thy throat, thou
> liest.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.126">Three parts of that receipt I had for
> Calais</span>  
> <span id="1.1.127">Disbursed I duly to his highness'
> soldiers;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.128">The other part reserved I by consent,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.129">For that my sovereign liege was in my debt</span>  
> <span id="1.1.130">Upon remainder of a dear account,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.131">Since last I went to France to fetch his
> queen:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.132">Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's
> death,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.133">I slew him not; but to my own disgrace</span>  
> <span id="1.1.134">Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.135">For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.136">The honourable father to my foe</span>  
> <span id="1.1.137">Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.138">A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul</span>  
> <span id="1.1.139">But ere I last received the sacrament</span>  
> <span id="1.1.140">I did confess it, and exactly begg'd</span>  
> <span id="1.1.141">Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.142">This is my fault: as for the rest
> appeall'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.143">It issues from the rancour of a villain,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.144">A recreant and most degenerate traitor</span>  
> <span id="1.1.145">Which in myself I boldly will defend;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.146">And interchangeably hurl down my gage</span>  
> <span id="1.1.147">Upon this overweening traitor's foot,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.148">To prove myself a loyal gentleman</span>  
> <span id="1.1.149">Even in the best blood chamber'd in his
> bosom.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.150">In haste whereof, most heartily I pray</span>  
> <span id="1.1.151">Your highness to assign our trial day.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.1.152">Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.153">Let's purge this choler without letting
> blood:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.154">This we prescribe, though no physician;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.155">Deep malice makes too deep incision;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.156">Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.157">Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.158">Good uncle, let this end where it begun;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.159">We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your

<span id="speech20">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="1.1.160">To be a make-peace shall become my age:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.161">Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's

<span id="speech21">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.1.162">And, Norfolk, throw down his.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="1.1.163">When, Harry, when?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.164">Obedience bids I should not bid again.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.1.165">Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no
> boot.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**THOMAS MOWBRAY**</span>

> <span id="1.1.166">Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy
> foot.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.167">My life thou shalt command, but not my
> shame:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.168">The one my duty owes; but my fair name,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.169">Despite of death that lives upon my grave,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.170">To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not

> <span id="1.1.171">I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled

> <span id="1.1.172">Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd

> <span id="1.1.173">The which no balm can cure but his

> <span id="1.1.174">Which breathed this poison.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.1.175">Rage must be withstood:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.176">Give me his gage: lions make leopards

<span id="speech26">**THOMAS MOWBRAY**</span>

> <span id="1.1.177">Yea, but not change his spots: take but my

> <span id="1.1.178">And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.179">The purest treasure mortal times afford</span>

> <span id="1.1.182">A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest</span>
