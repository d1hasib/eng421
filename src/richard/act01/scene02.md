## SCENE II

### The DUKE OF LANCASTER'S palace.

> *Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with DUCHESS*

<span id="speech1">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="1.2.1">Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood</span>  
> <span id="1.2.2">Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.3">To stir against the butchers of his life!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.4">But since correction lieth in those hands</span>  
> <span id="1.2.5">Which made the fault that we cannot correct,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.6">Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.7">Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.8">Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**DUCHESS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.9">Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.10">Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.11">Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art
> one,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.12">Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.13">Or seven fair branches springing from one
> root:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.14">Some of those seven are dried by nature's
> course,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.15">Some of those branches by the Destinies
> cut;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.16">But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my
> Gloucester,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.17">One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.18">One flourishing branch of his most royal
> root,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.19">Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor
> spilt,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.20">Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all
> faded,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.21">By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.22">Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that
> womb,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.23">That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd
> thee</span>  
> <span id="1.2.24">Made him a man; and though thou livest and
> breathest,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.25">Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost
> consent</span>  
> <span id="1.2.26">In some large measure to thy father's
> death,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.27">In that thou seest thy wretched brother
> die,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.28">Who was the model of thy father's life.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.29">Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.30">In suffering thus thy brother to be
> slaughter'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.31">Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.32">Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.33">That which in mean men we intitle patience</span>  
> <span id="1.2.34">Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.35">What shall I say? to safeguard thine own
> life,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.36">The best way is to venge my Gloucester's
> death.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="1.2.37">God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.38">His deputy anointed in His sight,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.39">Hath caused his death: the which if
> wrongfully,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.40">Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift</span>  
> <span id="1.2.41">An angry arm against His minister.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**DUCHESS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.42">Where then, alas, may I complain myself?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="1.2.43">To God, the widow's champion and defence.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**DUCHESS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.44">Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.45">Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold</span>  
> <span id="1.2.46">Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.47">O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's
> spear,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.48">That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.49">Or, if misfortune miss the first career,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.50">Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.51">They may break his foaming courser's back,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.52">And throw the rider headlong in the lists,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.53">A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.54">Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's
> wife</span>  
> <span id="1.2.55">With her companion grief must end her life.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="1.2.56">Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.57">As much good stay with thee as go with me!</span>  

<span id="speech8">**DUCHESS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.58">Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it
> falls,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.59">Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.60">I take my leave before I have begun,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.61">For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.62">Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.63">Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.64">Though this be all, do not so quickly go;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.65">I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.66">With all good speed at Plashy visit me.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.67">Alack, and what shall good old York there
> see</span>  
> <span id="1.2.68">But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.69">Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.70">And what hear there for welcome but my
> groans?</span>  
> <span id="1.2.71">Therefore commend me; let him not come
> there,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.72">To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.73">Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.74">The last leave of thee takes my weeping
> eye.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
