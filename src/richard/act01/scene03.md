> *Enter the Lord Marshal and the DUKE OF AUMERLE*

<span id="speech1">**Lord Marshal**</span>

> <span id="1.3.1">My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="1.3.2">Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**Lord Marshal**</span>

> <span id="1.3.3">The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.4">Stays but the summons of the appellant's
> trumpet.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="1.3.5">Why, then, the champions are prepared, and
> stay</span>  
> <span id="1.3.6">For nothing but his majesty's approach.</span>  
>
> *The trumpets sound, and KING RICHARD enters with his nobles, JOHN OF
> GAUNT, BUSHY, BAGOT, GREEN, and others. When they are set, enter
> THOMAS MOWBRAY in arms, defendant, with a Herald*

<span id="speech5">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.3.7">Marshal, demand of yonder champion</span>  
> <span id="1.3.8">The cause of his arrival here in arms:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.9">Ask him his name and orderly proceed</span>  
> <span id="1.3.10">To swear him in the justice of his cause.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Lord Marshal**</span>

> <span id="1.3.11">In God's name and the king's, say who thou
> art</span>  
> <span id="1.3.12">And why thou comest thus knightly clad in
> arms,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.13">Against what man thou comest, and what thy
> quarrel:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.14">Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy
> oath;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.15">As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!</span>  

<span id="speech7">**THOMAS MOWBRAY**</span>

> <span id="1.3.16">My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.17">Who hither come engaged by my oath--</span>  
> <span id="1.3.18">Which God defend a knight should violate!--</span>  
> <span id="1.3.19">Both to defend my loyalty and truth</span>  
> <span id="1.3.20">To God, my king and my succeeding issue,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.21">Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals
> me</span>  
> <span id="1.3.22">And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.23">To prove him, in defending of myself,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.24">A traitor to my God, my king, and me:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.25">And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!</span>  
>
> *The trumpets sound. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, appellant, in armour,
> with a Herald*

<span id="speech8">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.3.26">Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.27">Both who he is and why he cometh hither</span>  
> <span id="1.3.28">Thus plated in habiliments of war,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.29">And formally, according to our law,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.30">Depose him in the justice of his cause.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**Lord Marshal**</span>

> <span id="1.3.31">What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou
> hither,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.32">Before King Richard in his royal lists?</span>  
> <span id="1.3.33">Against whom comest thou? and what's thy
> quarrel?</span>  
> <span id="1.3.34">Speak like a true knight, so defend thee
> heaven!</span>  

<span id="speech10">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="1.3.35">Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby</span>  
> <span id="1.3.36">Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.37">To prove, by God's grace and my body's
> valour,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.38">In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of
> Norfolk,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.39">That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.40">To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.41">And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!</span>  

<span id="speech11">**Lord Marshal**</span>

> <span id="1.3.42">On pain of death, no person be so bold</span>  
> <span id="1.3.43">Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.44">Except the marshal and such officers</span>  
> <span id="1.3.45">Appointed to direct these fair designs.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="1.3.46">Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's
> hand,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.47">And bow my knee before his majesty:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.48">For Mowbray and myself are like two men</span>  
> <span id="1.3.49">That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.50">Then let us take a ceremonious leave</span>  
> <span id="1.3.51">And loving farewell of our several friends.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**Lord Marshal**</span>

> <span id="1.3.52">The appellant in all duty greets your
> highness,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.53">And craves to kiss your hand and take his
> leave.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.3.54">We will descend and fold him in our arms.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.55">Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.56">So be thy fortune in this royal fight!</span>  
> <span id="1.3.57">Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou
> shed,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.58">Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="1.3.59">O let no noble eye profane a tear</span>  
> <span id="1.3.60">For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.61">As confident as is the falcon's flight</span>  
> <span id="1.3.62">Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.63">My loving lord, I take my leave of you;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.64">Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.65">Not sick, although I have to do with death,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.66">But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing
> breath.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.67">Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet</span>  
> <span id="1.3.68">The daintiest last, to make the end most
> sweet:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.69">O thou, the earthly author of my blood,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.70">Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.71">Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up</span>  
> <span id="1.3.72">To reach at victory above my head,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.73">Add proof unto mine armour with thy
> prayers;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.74">And with thy blessings steel my lance's
> point,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.75">That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.76">And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.77">Even in the lusty havior of his son.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="1.3.78">God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!</span>  
> <span id="1.3.79">Be swift like lightning in the execution;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.80">And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.81">Fall like amazing thunder on the casque</span>  
> <span id="1.3.82">Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.83">Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and
> live.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="1.3.84">Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!</span>  

<span id="speech18">**THOMAS MOWBRAY**</span>

> <span id="1.3.85">However God or fortune cast my lot,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.86">There lives or dies, true to King Richard's

> <span id="1.3.87">A loyal, just and upright gentleman:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.88">Never did captive with a freer heart</span>  
> <span id="1.3.89">Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace</span>  
> <span id="1.3.90">His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.91">More than my dancing soul doth celebrate</span>  
> <span id="1.3.92">This feast of battle with mine adversary.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.93">Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.94">Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.95">As gentle and as jocund as to jest</span>  
> <span id="1.3.96">Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.3.97">Farewell, my lord: securely I espy</span>  
> <span id="1.3.98">Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.99">Order the trial, marshal, and begin.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**Lord Marshal**</span>

> <span id="1.3.100">Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.101">Receive thy lance; and God defend the

<span id="speech21">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="1.3.102">Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**Lord Marshal**</span>

> <span id="1.3.103">Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of

<span id="speech23">**First Herald**</span>

> <span id="1.3.104">Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.105">Stands here for God, his sovereign and

> <span id="1.3.106">On pain to be found false and recreant,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.107">To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas

> <span id="1.3.108">A traitor to his God, his king and him;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.109">And dares him to set forward to the fight.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**Second Herald**</span>

> <span id="1.3.110">Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of
> Norfolk,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.111">On pain to be found false and recreant,</span>

<span id="speech25">**Lord Marshal**</span>

> <span id="1.3.117">Sound, trumpets; and set forward,

>
> *A charge sounded*

> <span id="1.3.118">Stay, the king hath thrown his warder

<span id="speech26">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.3.119">Let them lay by their helmets and their

> <span id="1.3.125">For that our kingdom's earth should not be

> <span id="1.3.126">With that dear blood which it hath

> <span id="1.3.127">And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect</span>  
> <span id="1.3.128">Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours'

> <span id="1.3.129">And for we think the eagle-winged pride</span>

> <span id="1.3.131">With rival-hating envy, set on you</span>

<span id="speech27">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="1.3.144">Your will be done: this must my comfort

<span id="speech28">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.3.148">Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,</span>

> <span id="1.3.152">The hopeless word of 'never to return'</span>  
> <span id="1.3.153">Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**THOMAS MOWBRAY**</span>

> <span id="1.3.154">A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.155">And all unlook'd for from your highness'

> <span id="1.3.156">A dearer merit, not so deep a maim</span>

> <span id="1.3.160">My native English, now I must forego:</span>

> <span id="1.3.163">Or like a cunning instrument cased up,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.164">Or, being open, put into his hands</span>  
> <span id="1.3.165">That knows no touch to tune the harmony:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.166">Within my mouth you have engaol'd my

> <span id="1.3.167">Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and

> <span id="1.3.168">And dull unfeeling barren ignorance</span>

<span id="speech30">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="1.3.174">It boots thee not to be compassionate:</span>

<span id="speech31">**THOMAS MOWBRAY**</span>

> <span id="1.3.176">Then thus I turn me from my country's

<span id="speech32">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

<span id="speech33">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>
