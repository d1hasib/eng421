## SCENE IV

### A camp in Wales.

> *Enter EARL OF SALISBURY and a Welsh Captain*

<span id="speech1">**Captain**</span>

> <span id="2.4.1">My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten
> days,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.2">And hardly kept our countrymen together,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.3">And yet we hear no tidings from the king;</span>  
> <span id="2.4.4">Therefore we will disperse ourselves:
> farewell.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**EARL OF SALISBURY**</span>

> <span id="2.4.5">Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:</span>  
> <span id="2.4.6">The king reposeth all his confidence in
> thee.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**Captain**</span>

> <span id="2.4.7">'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not
> stay.</span>  
> <span id="2.4.8">The bay-trees in our country are all
> wither'd</span>  
> <span id="2.4.9">And meteors fright the fixed stars of
> heaven;</span>  
> <span id="2.4.10">The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the
> earth</span>  
> <span id="2.4.11">And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful
> change;</span>  
> <span id="2.4.12">Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and
> leap,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.13">The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.14">The other to enjoy by rage and war:</span>  
> <span id="2.4.15">These signs forerun the death or fall of
> kings.</span>  
> <span id="2.4.16">Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.17">As well assured Richard their king is dead.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech4">**EARL OF SALISBURY**</span>

> <span id="2.4.18">Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind</span>  
> <span id="2.4.19">I see thy glory like a shooting star</span>  
> <span id="2.4.20">Fall to the base earth from the firmament.</span>  
> <span id="2.4.21">Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.22">Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:</span>  
> <span id="2.4.23">Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.24">And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.</span>  
>
> *Exit*
