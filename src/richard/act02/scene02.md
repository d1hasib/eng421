## SCENE II

### The palace.

> *Enter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT*

<span id="speech1">**BUSHY**</span>

> <span id="2.2.1">Madam, your majesty is too much sad:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.2">You promised, when you parted with the king,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.3">To lay aside life-harming heaviness</span>  
> <span id="2.2.4">And entertain a cheerful disposition.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.5">To please the king I did; to please myself</span>  
> <span id="2.2.6">I cannot do it; yet I know no cause</span>  
> <span id="2.2.7">Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.8">Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest</span>  
> <span id="2.2.9">As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.10">Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.11">Is coming towards me, and my inward soul</span>  
> <span id="2.2.12">With nothing trembles: at some thing it
> grieves,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.13">More than with parting from my lord the
> king.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**BUSHY**</span>

> <span id="2.2.14">Each substance of a grief hath twenty
> shadows,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.15">Which shows like grief itself, but is not
> so;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.16">For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding
> tears,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.17">Divides one thing entire to many objects;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.18">Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon</span>  
> <span id="2.2.19">Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry</span>  
> <span id="2.2.20">Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.21">Looking awry upon your lord's departure,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.22">Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to
> wail;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.23">Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but
> shadows</span>  
> <span id="2.2.24">Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious
> queen,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.25">More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not
> seen;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.26">Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.27">Which for things true weeps things
> imaginary.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.28">It may be so; but yet my inward soul</span>  
> <span id="2.2.29">Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it
> be,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.30">I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad</span>  
> <span id="2.2.31">As, though on thinking on no thought I
> think,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.32">Makes me with heavy nothing faint and
> shrink.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**BUSHY**</span>

> <span id="2.2.33">'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.34">'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived</span>  
> <span id="2.2.35">From some forefather grief; mine is not so,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.36">For nothing had begot my something grief;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.37">Or something hath the nothing that I
> grieve:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.38">'Tis in reversion that I do possess;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.39">But what it is, that is not yet known; what</span>  
> <span id="2.2.40">I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.</span>  
>
> *Enter GREEN*

<span id="speech7">**GREEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.41">God save your majesty! and well met,
> gentlemen:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.42">I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for
> Ireland.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.43">Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.44">For his designs crave haste, his haste good
> hope:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.45">Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not
> shipp'd?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**GREEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.46">That he, our hope, might have retired his
> power,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.47">And driven into despair an enemy's hope,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.48">Who strongly hath set footing in this land:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.49">The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.50">And with uplifted arms is safe arrived</span>  
> <span id="2.2.51">At Ravenspurgh.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.52">Now God in heaven forbid!</span>  

<span id="speech11">**GREEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.53">Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is
> worse,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.54">The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry
> Percy,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.55">The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and
> Willoughby,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.56">With all their powerful friends, are fled to
> him.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**BUSHY**</span>

> <span id="2.2.57">Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland</span>  
> <span id="2.2.58">And all the rest revolted faction traitors?</span>  

<span id="speech13">**GREEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.59">We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester</span>  
> <span id="2.2.60">Hath broke his staff, resign'd his
> stewardship,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.61">And all the household servants fled with
> him</span>  
> <span id="2.2.62">To Bolingbroke.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.63">So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.64">And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.65">Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.66">And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.67">Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**BUSHY**</span>

> <span id="2.2.68">Despair not, madam.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.69">Who shall hinder me?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.70">I will despair, and be at enmity</span>  
> <span id="2.2.71">With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.72">A parasite, a keeper back of death,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.73">Who gently would dissolve the bands of
> life,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.74">Which false hope lingers in extremity.</span>  
>
> *Enter DUKE OF YORK*

<span id="speech17">**GREEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.75">Here comes the Duke of York.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.76">With signs of war about his aged neck:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.77">O, full of careful business are his looks!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.78">Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable
> words.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="2.2.79">Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.80">Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the
> earth,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.81">Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and
> grief.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.82">Your husband, he is gone to save far off,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.83">Whilst others come to make him lose at
> home:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.84">Here am I left to underprop his land,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.85">Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.86">Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit
> made;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.87">Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd
> him.</span>  
>
> *Enter a Servant*

<span id="speech20">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="2.2.88">My lord, your son was gone before I came.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="2.2.89">He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.90">The nobles they are fled, the commons they are
> cold,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.91">And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's
> side.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.92">Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister
> Gloucester;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.93">Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.94">Hold, take my ring.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="2.2.95">My lord, I had forgot to tell your
> lordship,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.96">To-day, as I came by, I called there;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.97">But I shall grieve you to report the rest.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="2.2.98">What is't, knave?</span>  

<span id="speech24">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="2.2.99">An hour before I came, the duchess died.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="2.2.100">God for his mercy! what a tide of woes</span>  
> <span id="2.2.101">Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.102">I know not what to do: I would to God,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.103">So my untruth had not provoked him to it,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.104">The king had cut off my head with my
> brother's.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.105">What, are there no posts dispatch'd for
> Ireland?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.106">How shall we do for money for these wars?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.107">Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon
> me.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.108">Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some
> carts</span>  
> <span id="2.2.109">And bring away the armour that is there.</span>  
>
> *Exit Servant*
>
> <span id="2.2.110">Gentlemen, will you go muster men?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.111">If I know how or which way to order these
> affairs</span>  
> <span id="2.2.112">Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.113">Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.114">The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath</span>  
> <span id="2.2.115">And duty bids defend; the other again</span>  
> <span id="2.2.116">Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.117">Whom conscience and my kindred bids to
> right.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.118">Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin,
> I'll</span>  
> <span id="2.2.119">Dispose of you.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.120">Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.121">And meet me presently at Berkeley.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.122">I should to Plashy too;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.123">But time will not permit: all is uneven,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.124">And every thing is left at six and seven.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt DUKE OF YORK and QUEEN*

<span id="speech26">**BUSHY**</span>

> <span id="2.2.125">The wind sits fair for news to go to
> Ireland,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.126">But none returns. For us to levy power</span>  
> <span id="2.2.127">Proportionable to the enemy</span>  
> <span id="2.2.128">Is all unpossible.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**GREEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.129">Besides, our nearness to the king in love</span>  
> <span id="2.2.130">Is near the hate of those love not the
> king.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**BAGOT**</span>

> <span id="2.2.131">And that's the wavering commons: for their
> love</span>  
> <span id="2.2.132">Lies in their purses, and whoso empties
> them</span>  
> <span id="2.2.133">By so much fills their hearts with deadly
> hate.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**BUSHY**</span>

> <span id="2.2.134">Wherein the king stands generally
> condemn'd.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**BAGOT**</span>

> <span id="2.2.135">If judgement lie in them, then so do we,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.136">Because we ever have been near the king.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**GREEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.137">Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol
> castle:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.138">The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**BUSHY**</span>

> <span id="2.2.139">Thither will I with you; for little office</span>  
> <span id="2.2.140">The hateful commons will perform for us,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.141">Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.142">Will you go along with us?</span>  

<span id="speech33">**BAGOT**</span>

> <span id="2.2.143">No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.144">Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.145">We three here art that ne'er shall meet
> again.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**BUSHY**</span>

> <span id="2.2.146">That's as York thrives to beat back
> Bolingbroke.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**GREEN**</span>

> <span id="2.2.147">Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes</span>  
> <span id="2.2.148">Is numbering sands and drinking oceans
> dry:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.149">Where one on his side fights, thousands will
> fly.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.150">Farewell at once, for once, for all, and
> ever.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**BUSHY**</span>

> <span id="2.2.151">Well, we may meet again.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**BAGOT**</span>

> <span id="2.2.152">I fear me, never.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
