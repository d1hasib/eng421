### Ely House.

> *Enter JOHN OF GAUNT sick, with the DUKE OF YORK, & c*

<span id="speech1">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="2.1.1">Will the king come, that I may breathe my
> last</span>  
> <span id="2.1.2">In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="2.1.3">Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your
> breath;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.4">For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="2.1.5">O, but they say the tongues of dying men</span>  
> <span id="2.1.6">Enforce attention like deep harmony:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.7">Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in
> vain,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.8">For they breathe truth that breathe their words in
> pain.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.9">He that no more must say is listen'd more</span>  
> <span id="2.1.10">Than they whom youth and ease have taught to
> glose;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.11">More are men's ends mark'd than their lives
> before:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.12">The setting sun, and music at the close,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.13">As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest
> last,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.14">Writ in remembrance more than things long
> past:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.15">Though Richard my life's counsel would not
> hear,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.16">My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="2.1.17">No; it is stopp'd with other flattering
> sounds,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.18">As praises, of whose taste the wise are
> fond,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.19">Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound</span>  
> <span id="2.1.20">The open ear of youth doth always listen;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.21">Report of fashions in proud Italy,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.22">Whose manners still our tardy apish nation</span>  
> <span id="2.1.23">Limps after in base imitation.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.24">Where doth the world thrust forth a
> vanity--</span>  
> <span id="2.1.25">So it be new, there's no respect how vile--</span>  
> <span id="2.1.26">That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.27">Then all too late comes counsel to be
> heard,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.28">Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.29">Direct not him whose way himself will
> choose:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.30">'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou
> lose.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="2.1.31">Methinks I am a prophet new inspired</span>  
> <span id="2.1.32">And thus expiring do foretell of him:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.33">His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.34">For violent fires soon burn out themselves;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.35">Small showers last long, but sudden storms are
> short;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.36">He tires betimes that spurs too fast
> betimes;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.37">With eager feeding food doth choke the
> feeder:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.38">Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.39">Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.40">This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd
> isle,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.41">This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.42">This other Eden, demi-paradise,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.43">This fortress built by Nature for herself</span>  
> <span id="2.1.44">Against infection and the hand of war,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.45">This happy breed of men, this little world,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.46">This precious stone set in the silver sea,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.47">Which serves it in the office of a wall,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.48">Or as a moat defensive to a house,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.49">Against the envy of less happier lands,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.50">This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this
> England,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.51">This nurse, this teeming womb of royal
> kings,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.52">Fear'd by their breed and famous by their
> birth,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.53">Renowned for their deeds as far from home,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.54">For Christian service and true chivalry,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.55">As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.56">Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.57">This land of such dear souls, this dear dear
> land,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.58">Dear for her reputation through the world,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.59">Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.60">Like to a tenement or pelting farm:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.61">England, bound in with the triumphant sea</span>  
> <span id="2.1.62">Whose rocky shore beats back the envious
> siege</span>  
> <span id="2.1.63">Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with
> shame,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.64">With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.65">That England, that was wont to conquer
> others,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.66">Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.67">Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.68">How happy then were my ensuing death!</span>  
>
> *Enter KING RICHARD II and QUEEN, DUKE OF AUMERLE, BUSHY, GREEN,
> BAGOT, LORD ROSS, and LORD WILLOUGHBY*

<span id="speech6">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="2.1.69">The king is come: deal mildly with his
> youth;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.70">For young hot colts being raged do rage the
> more.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="2.1.71">How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="2.1.72">What comfort, man? how is't with aged
> Gaunt?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="2.1.73">O how that name befits my composition!</span>  
> <span id="2.1.74">Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.75">Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.76">And who abstains from meat that is not
> gaunt?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.77">For sleeping England long time have I
> watch'd;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.78">Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all
> gaunt:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.79">The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.80">Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's
> looks;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.81">And therein fasting, hast thou made me
> gaunt:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.82">Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.83">Whose hollow womb inherits nought but
> bones.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="2.1.84">Can sick men play so nicely with their
> names?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="2.1.85">No, misery makes sport to mock itself:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.86">Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.87">I mock my name, great king, to flatter
> thee.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="2.1.88">Should dying men flatter with those that
> live?</span>  

<span id="speech13">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="2.1.89">No, no, men living flatter those that die.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="2.1.90">Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest
> me.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="2.1.91">O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="2.1.92">I am in health, I breathe, and see thee
> ill.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="2.1.93">Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.94">Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing
> ill.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.95">Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land</span>  
> <span id="2.1.96">Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.97">And thou, too careless patient as thou art,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.98">Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure</span>  
> <span id="2.1.99">Of those physicians that first wounded
> thee:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.100">A thousand flatterers sit within thy
> crown,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.101">Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.102">And yet, incaged in so small a verge,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.103">The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.104">O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye</span>  
> <span id="2.1.105">Seen how his son's son should destroy his
> sons,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.106">From forth thy reach he would have laid thy
> shame,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.107">Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.108">Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.109">Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the
> world,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.110">It were a shame to let this land by lease;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.111">But for thy world enjoying but this land,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.112">Is it not more than shame to shame it so?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.113">Landlord of England art thou now, not
> king:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.114">Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And
> thou--</span>  

<span id="speech18">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="2.1.115">A lunatic lean-witted fool,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.116">Presuming on an ague's privilege,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.117">Darest with thy frozen admonition</span>  
> <span id="2.1.118">Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal
> blood</span>  
> <span id="2.1.119">With fury from his native residence.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.120">Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.121">Wert thou not brother to great Edward's
> son,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.122">This tongue that runs so roundly in thy
> head</span>  
> <span id="2.1.123">Should run thy head from thy unreverent
> shoulders.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**JOHN OF GAUNT**</span>

> <span id="2.1.124">O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.125">For that I was his father Edward's son;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.126">That blood already, like the pelican,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.127">Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly

> <span id="2.1.132">Join with the present sickness that I

> *Exit, borne off by his Attendants*

<span id="speech20">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="2.1.155">His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.156">So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:</span>
