## SCENE III

### Wilds in Gloucestershire.

> *Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND, with Forces*

<span id="speech1">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="2.3.1">How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="2.3.2">Believe me, noble lord,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.3">I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.4">These high wild hills and rough uneven ways</span>  
> <span id="2.3.5">Draws out our miles, and makes them
> wearisome,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.6">And yet your fair discourse hath been as
> sugar,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.7">Making the hard way sweet and delectable.</span>  
> <span id="2.3.8">But I bethink me what a weary way</span>  
> <span id="2.3.9">From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found</span>  
> <span id="2.3.10">In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your
> company,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.11">Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled</span>  
> <span id="2.3.12">The tediousness and process of my travel:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.13">But theirs is sweetened with the hope to
> have</span>  
> <span id="2.3.14">The present benefit which I possess;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.15">And hope to joy is little less in joy</span>  
> <span id="2.3.16">Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords</span>  
> <span id="2.3.17">Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath
> done</span>  
> <span id="2.3.18">By sight of what I have, your noble
> company.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="2.3.19">Of much less value is my company</span>  
> <span id="2.3.20">Than your good words. But who comes here?</span>  
>
> *Enter HENRY PERCY*

<span id="speech4">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="2.3.21">It is my son, young Harry Percy,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.22">Sent from my brother Worcester,
> whencesoever.</span>  
> <span id="2.3.23">Harry, how fares your uncle?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**HENRY PERCY**</span>

> <span id="2.3.24">I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health
> of you.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="2.3.25">Why, is he not with the queen?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**HENRY PERCY**</span>

> <span id="2.3.26">No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the
> court,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.27">Broken his staff of office and dispersed</span>  
> <span id="2.3.28">The household of the king.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="2.3.29">What was his reason?</span>  
> <span id="2.3.30">He was not so resolved when last we spake
> together.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**HENRY PERCY**</span>

> <span id="2.3.31">Because your lordship was proclaimed
> traitor.</span>  
> <span id="2.3.32">But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.33">To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.34">And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover</span>  
> <span id="2.3.35">What power the Duke of York had levied
> there;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.36">Then with directions to repair to
> Ravenspurgh.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="2.3.37">Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**HENRY PERCY**</span>

> <span id="2.3.38">No, my good lord, for that is not forgot</span>  
> <span id="2.3.39">Which ne'er I did remember: to my
> knowledge,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.40">I never in my life did look on him.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="2.3.41">Then learn to know him now; this is the
> duke.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**HENRY PERCY**</span>

> <span id="2.3.42">My gracious lord, I tender you my service,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.43">Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.44">Which elder days shall ripen and confirm</span>  
> <span id="2.3.45">To more approved service and desert.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="2.3.46">I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure</span>  
> <span id="2.3.47">I count myself in nothing else so happy</span>  
> <span id="2.3.48">As in a soul remembering my good friends;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.49">And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.50">It shall be still thy true love's
> recompense:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.51">My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals
> it.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="2.3.52">How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir</span>  
> <span id="2.3.53">Keeps good old York there with his men of
> war?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**HENRY PERCY**</span>

> <span id="2.3.54">There stands the castle, by yon tuft of
> trees,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.55">Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have
> heard;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.56">And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and
> Seymour;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.57">None else of name and noble estimate.</span>  
>
> *Enter LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY*

<span id="speech17">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="2.3.58">Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.59">Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="2.3.60">Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues</span>  
> <span id="2.3.61">A banish'd traitor: all my treasury</span>  
> <span id="2.3.62">Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more
> enrich'd</span>  
> <span id="2.3.63">Shall be your love and labour's recompense.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**LORD ROSS**</span>

> <span id="2.3.64">Your presence makes us rich, most noble
> lord.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**LORD WILLOUGHBY**</span>

> <span id="2.3.65">And far surmounts our labour to attain it.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="2.3.66">Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.67">Which, till my infant fortune comes to
> years,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.68">Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?</span>  
>
> *Enter LORD BERKELEY*

<span id="speech22">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="2.3.69">It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**LORD BERKELEY**</span>

> <span id="2.3.70">My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="2.3.71">My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.72">And I am come to seek that name in England;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.73">And I must find that title in your tongue,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.74">Before I make reply to aught you say.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**LORD BERKELEY**</span>

> <span id="2.3.75">Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my
> meaning</span>  
> <span id="2.3.76">To raze one title of your honour out:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.77">To you, my lord, I come, what lord you
> will,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.78">From the most gracious regent of this land,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.79">The Duke of York, to know what pricks you
> on</span>  
> <span id="2.3.80">To take advantage of the absent time</span>  
> <span id="2.3.81">And fright our native peace with self-born
> arms.</span>  
>
> *Enter DUKE OF YORK attended*

<span id="speech26">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="2.3.82">I shall not need transport my words by you;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.83">Here comes his grace in person. My noble
> uncle!</span>  
>
> *Kneels*

<span id="speech27">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="2.3.84">Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.85">Whose duty is deceiveable and false.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="2.3.86">My gracious uncle--</span>  

<span id="speech29">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="2.3.87">Tut, tut!</span>  
> <span id="2.3.88">Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.89">I am no traitor's uncle; and that word
> 'grace.'</span>  
> <span id="2.3.90">In an ungracious mouth is but profane.</span>  
> <span id="2.3.91">Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs</span>  
> <span id="2.3.92">Dared once to touch a dust of England's
> ground?</span>  
> <span id="2.3.93">But then more 'why?' why have they dared to
> march</span>  
> <span id="2.3.94">So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.95">Frighting her pale-faced villages with war</span>  
> <span id="2.3.96">And ostentation of despised arms?</span>  
> <span id="2.3.97">Comest thou because the anointed king is
> hence?</span>  
> <span id="2.3.98">Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.99">And in my loyal bosom lies his power.</span>  
> <span id="2.3.100">Were I but now the lord of such hot youth</span>  
> <span id="2.3.101">As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and
> myself</span>  
> <span id="2.3.102">Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of
> men,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.103">From forth the ranks of many thousand
> French,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.104">O, then how quickly should this arm of
> mine.</span>  
> <span id="2.3.105">Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee</span>  
> <span id="2.3.106">And minister correction to thy fault!</span>  

<span id="speech30">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="2.3.107">My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.108">On what condition stands it and wherein?</span>  

<span id="speech31">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="2.3.109">Even in condition of the worst degree,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.110">In gross rebellion and detested treason:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.111">Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come</span>  
> <span id="2.3.112">Before the expiration of thy time,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.113">In braving arms against thy sovereign.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="2.3.114">As I was banish'd, I was banish'd
> Hereford;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.115">But as I come, I come for Lancaster.</span>  
> <span id="2.3.116">And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace</span>  
> <span id="2.3.117">Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.118">You are my father, for methinks in you</span>  
> <span id="2.3.119">I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.120">Will you permit that I shall stand
> condemn'd</span>  
> <span id="2.3.121">A wandering vagabond; my rights and
> royalties</span>  
> <span id="2.3.122">Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given
> away</span>  
> <span id="2.3.123">To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I
> born?</span>  
> <span id="2.3.124">If that my cousin king be King of England,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.125">It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.</span>  
> <span id="2.3.126">You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.127">Had you first died, and he been thus trod
> down,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.128">He should have found his uncle Gaunt a
> father,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.129">To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the
> bay.</span>  
> <span id="2.3.130">I am denied to sue my livery here,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.131">And yet my letters-patents give me leave:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.132">My father's goods are all distrain'd and
> sold,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.133">And these and all are all amiss employ'd.</span>  
> <span id="2.3.134">What would you have me do? I am a subject,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.135">And I challenge law: attorneys are denied
> me;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.136">And therefore, personally I lay my claim</span>  
> <span id="2.3.137">To my inheritance of free descent.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="2.3.138">The noble duke hath been too much abused.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**LORD ROSS**</span>

> <span id="2.3.139">It stands your grace upon to do him right.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**LORD WILLOUGHBY**</span>

> <span id="2.3.140">Base men by his endowments are made great.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="2.3.141">My lords of England, let me tell you this:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.142">I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs</span>  
> <span id="2.3.143">And laboured all I could to do him right;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.144">But in this kind to come, in braving arms,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.145">Be his own carver and cut out his way,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.146">To find out right with wrong, it may not
> be;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.147">And you that do abet him in this kind</span>  
> <span id="2.3.148">Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="2.3.149">The noble duke hath sworn his coming is</span>  
> <span id="2.3.150">But for his own; and for the right of that</span>  
> <span id="2.3.151">We all have strongly sworn to give him
> aid;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.152">And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that
> oath!</span>  

<span id="speech38">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="2.3.153">Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.154">I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.155">Because my power is weak and all ill left:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.156">But if I could, by Him that gave me life,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.157">I would attach you all and make you stoop</span>  
> <span id="2.3.158">Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.159">But since I cannot, be it known to you</span>  
> <span id="2.3.160">I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.161">Unless you please to enter in the castle</span>  
> <span id="2.3.162">And there repose you for this night.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="2.3.163">An offer, uncle, that we will accept:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.164">But we must win your grace to go with us</span>  
> <span id="2.3.165">To Bristol castle, which they say is held</span>  
> <span id="2.3.166">By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.167">The caterpillars of the commonwealth,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.168">Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="2.3.169">It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll
> pause;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.170">For I am loath to break our country's
> laws.</span>  
> <span id="2.3.171">Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you
> are:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.172">Things past redress are now with me past
> care.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
