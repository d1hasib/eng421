## SCENE I

### Westminster Hall.

> *Enter, as to the Parliament, HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF AUMERLE,
> NORTHUMBERLAND, HENRY PERCY, LORD FITZWATER, DUKE OF SURREY, the
> BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the Abbot Of Westminster, and another Lord,
> Herald, Officers, and BAGOT*

<span id="speech1">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.1">Call forth Bagot.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.2">Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.3">What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's
> death,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.4">Who wrought it with the king, and who
> perform'd</span>  
> <span id="4.1.5">The bloody office of his timeless end.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**BAGOT**</span>

> <span id="4.1.6">Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.7">Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**BAGOT**</span>

> <span id="4.1.8">My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue</span>  
> <span id="4.1.9">Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.10">In that dead time when Gloucester's death was
> plotted,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.11">I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.12">That reacheth from the restful English
> court</span>  
> <span id="4.1.13">As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'</span>  
> <span id="4.1.14">Amongst much other talk, that very time,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.15">I heard you say that you had rather refuse</span>  
> <span id="4.1.16">The offer of an hundred thousand crowns</span>  
> <span id="4.1.17">Than Bolingbroke's return to England;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.18">Adding withal how blest this land would be</span>  
> <span id="4.1.19">In this your cousin's death.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.20">Princes and noble lords,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.21">What answer shall I make to this base man?</span>  
> <span id="4.1.22">Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.23">On equal terms to give him chastisement?</span>  
> <span id="4.1.24">Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd</span>  
> <span id="4.1.25">With the attainder of his slanderous lips.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.26">There is my gage, the manual seal of death,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.27">That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou
> liest,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.28">And will maintain what thou hast said is
> false</span>  
> <span id="4.1.29">In thy heart-blood, though being all too
> base</span>  
> <span id="4.1.30">To stain the temper of my knightly sword.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.31">Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.32">Excepting one, I would he were the best</span>  
> <span id="4.1.33">In all this presence that hath moved me so.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**LORD FITZWATER**</span>

> <span id="4.1.34">If that thy valour stand on sympathy,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.35">There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to
> thine:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.36">By that fair sun which shows me where thou
> stand'st,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.37">I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest
> it</span>  
> <span id="4.1.38">That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's
> death.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.39">If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou
> liest;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.40">And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.41">Where it was forged, with my rapier's
> point.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.42">Thou darest not, coward, live to see that
> day.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**LORD FITZWATER**</span>

> <span id="4.1.43">Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.44">Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for
> this.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**HENRY PERCY**</span>

> <span id="4.1.45">Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true</span>  
> <span id="4.1.46">In this appeal as thou art all unjust;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.47">And that thou art so, there I throw my
> gage,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.48">To prove it on thee to the extremest point</span>  
> <span id="4.1.49">Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou
> darest.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.50">An if I do not, may my hands rot off</span>  
> <span id="4.1.51">And never brandish more revengeful steel</span>  
> <span id="4.1.52">Over the glittering helmet of my foe!</span>  

<span id="speech14">**Lord**</span>

> <span id="4.1.53">I task the earth to the like, forsworn
> Aumerle;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.54">And spur thee on with full as many lies</span>  
> <span id="4.1.55">As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear</span>  
> <span id="4.1.56">From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.57">Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.58">Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at
> all:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.59">I have a thousand spirits in one breast,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.60">To answer twenty thousand such as you.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**DUKE OF SURREY**</span>

> <span id="4.1.61">My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well</span>  
> <span id="4.1.62">The very time Aumerle and you did talk.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**LORD FITZWATER**</span>

> <span id="4.1.63">'Tis very true: you were in presence then;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.64">And you can witness with me this is true.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**DUKE OF SURREY**</span>

> <span id="4.1.65">As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is
> true.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**LORD FITZWATER**</span>

> <span id="4.1.66">Surrey, thou liest.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**DUKE OF SURREY**</span>

> <span id="4.1.67">Dishonourable boy!</span>  
> <span id="4.1.68">That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.69">That it shall render vengeance and revenge</span>  
> <span id="4.1.70">Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie</span>  
> <span id="4.1.71">In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.72">In proof whereof, there is my honour's
> pawn;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.73">Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**LORD FITZWATER**</span>

> <span id="4.1.74">How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!</span>  
> <span id="4.1.75">If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or
> live,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.76">I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.77">And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.78">And lies, and lies: there is my bond of
> faith,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.79">To tie thee to my strong correction.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.80">As I intend to thrive in this new world,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.81">Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.82">Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say</span>  
> <span id="4.1.83">That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy
> men</span>  
> <span id="4.1.84">To execute the noble duke at Calais.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.85">Some honest Christian trust me with a gage</span>  
> <span id="4.1.86">That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down
> this,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.87">If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.88">These differences shall all rest under gage</span>  
> <span id="4.1.89">Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall
> be,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.90">And, though mine enemy, restored again</span>  
> <span id="4.1.91">To all his lands and signories: when he's
> return'd,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.92">Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**BISHOP OF CARLISLE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.93">That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.94">Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought</span>  
> <span id="4.1.95">For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian
> field,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.96">Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross</span>  
> <span id="4.1.97">Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.98">And toil'd with works of war, retired
> himself</span>  
> <span id="4.1.99">To Italy; and there at Venice gave</span>  
> <span id="4.1.100">His body to that pleasant country's earth,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.101">And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.102">Under whose colours he had fought so long.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.103">Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?</span>  

<span id="speech26">**BISHOP OF CARLISLE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.104">As surely as I live, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.105">Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the
> bosom</span>  
> <span id="4.1.106">Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.107">Your differences shall all rest under gage</span>  
> <span id="4.1.108">Till we assign you to your days of trial.</span>

> *Enter DUKE OF YORK, attended*

<span id="speech28">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="4.1.109">Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee</span>  
> <span id="4.1.110">From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing

> <span id="4.1.111">Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre

<span id="speech29">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.115">In God's name, I'll ascend the regal

<span id="speech30">**BISHOP OF CARLISLE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.116">Marry. God forbid!</span>  
> <span id="4.1.117">Worst in this royal presence may I speak,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.118">Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.119">Would God that any in this noble presence</span>  
> <span id="4.1.120">Were enough noble to be upright judge</span>  
> <span id="4.1.121">Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would</span>

<span id="speech35">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="4.1.165">Alack, why am I sent for to a king,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.166">Before I have shook off the regal thoughts</span>

<span id="speech50">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

<span id="speech53">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

<span id="speech54">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="4.1.276">The commons will not then be satisfied.</span>  

<span id="speech55">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

<span id="speech57">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="4.1.298">Say that again.</span>

> <span id="4.1.300">'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;</span>

<span id="speech58">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.310">Name it, fair cousin.</span>  

<span id="speech59">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="4.1.311">'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:</span>

<span id="speech61">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="4.1.318">You shall.</span>  

<span id="speech63">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="4.1.319">Then give me leave to go.</span>  

<span id="speech64">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

<span id="speech66">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

<span id="speech67">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

<span id="speech69">**Abbot**</span>

> <span id="4.1.327">A woeful pageant have we here beheld.</span>  

<span id="speech70">**BISHOP OF CARLISLE**</span>

<span id="speech71">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="4.1.330">You holy clergymen, is there no plot</span>

<span id="speech72">**Abbot**</span>

> <span id="4.1.332">My lord,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.333">Before I freely speak my mind herein,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.334">You shall not only take the sacrament</span>  
> <span id="4.1.335">To bury mine intents, but also to effect</span>
