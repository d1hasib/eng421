## SCENE III

### Wales. Before Flint castle.

> *Enter, with drum and colours, HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK,
> NORTHUMBERLAND, Attendants, and forces*

<span id="speech1">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="3.3.1">So that by this intelligence we learn</span>  
> <span id="3.3.2">The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury</span>  
> <span id="3.3.3">Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed</span>  
> <span id="3.3.4">With some few private friends upon this
> coast.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="3.3.5">The news is very fair and good, my lord:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.6">Richard not far from hence hath hid his
> head.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="3.3.7">It would beseem the Lord Northumberland</span>  
> <span id="3.3.8">To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day</span>  
> <span id="3.3.9">When such a sacred king should hide his
> head.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="3.3.10">Your grace mistakes; only to be brief</span>  
> <span id="3.3.11">Left I his title out.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="3.3.12">The time hath been,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.13">Would you have been so brief with him, he
> would</span>  
> <span id="3.3.14">Have been so brief with you, to shorten
> you,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.15">For taking so the head, your whole head's
> length.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="3.3.16">Mistake not, uncle, further than you
> should.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="3.3.17">Take not, good cousin, further than you
> should.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.18">Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our
> heads.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="3.3.19">I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself</span>  
> <span id="3.3.20">Against their will. But who comes here?</span>  
>
> *Enter HENRY PERCY*
>
> <span id="3.3.21">Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle
> yield?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**HENRY PERCY**</span>

> <span id="3.3.22">The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.23">Against thy entrance.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="3.3.24">Royally!</span>  
> <span id="3.3.25">Why, it contains no king?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**HENRY PERCY**</span>

> <span id="3.3.26">Yes, my good lord,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.27">It doth contain a king; King Richard lies</span>  
> <span id="3.3.28">Within the limits of yon lime and stone:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.29">And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord
> Salisbury,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.30">Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman</span>  
> <span id="3.3.31">Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="3.3.32">O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="3.3.33">Noble lords,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.34">Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.35">Through brazen trumpet send the breath of
> parley</span>  
> <span id="3.3.36">Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.37">Henry Bolingbroke</span>  
> <span id="3.3.38">On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's
> hand</span>  
> <span id="3.3.39">And sends allegiance and true faith of
> heart</span>  
> <span id="3.3.40">To his most royal person, hither come</span>  
> <span id="3.3.41">Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.42">Provided that my banishment repeal'd</span>  
> <span id="3.3.43">And lands restored again be freely granted:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.44">If not, I'll use the advantage of my power</span>  
> <span id="3.3.45">And lay the summer's dust with showers of
> blood</span>  
> <span id="3.3.46">Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd
> Englishmen:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.47">The which, how far off from the mind of
> Bolingbroke</span>  
> <span id="3.3.48">It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench</span>  
> <span id="3.3.49">The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's
> land,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.50">My stooping duty tenderly shall show.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.51">Go, signify as much, while here we march</span>  
> <span id="3.3.52">Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.53">Let's march without the noise of threatening
> drum,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.54">That from this castle's tatter'd
> battlements</span>  
> <span id="3.3.55">Our fair appointments may be well perused.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.56">Methinks King Richard and myself should
> meet</span>  
> <span id="3.3.57">With no less terror than the elements</span>  
> <span id="3.3.58">Of fire and water, when their thundering
> shock</span>  
> <span id="3.3.59">At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of
> heaven.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.60">Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.61">The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain</span>  
> <span id="3.3.62">My waters; on the earth, and not on him.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.63">March on, and mark King Richard how he
> looks.</span>  
>
> *Parle without, and answer within. Then a flourish. Enter on the
> walls, KING RICHARD II, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, SIR
> STEPHEN SCROOP, and EARL OF SALISBURY*
>
> <span id="3.3.64">See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.65">As doth the blushing discontented sun</span>  
> <span id="3.3.66">From out the fiery portal of the east,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.67">When he perceives the envious clouds are
> bent</span>  
> <span id="3.3.68">To dim his glory and to stain the track</span>  
> <span id="3.3.69">Of his bright passage to the occident.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="3.3.70">Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.71">As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth</span>  
> <span id="3.3.72">Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.73">That any harm should stain so fair a show!</span>  

<span id="speech15">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.3.74">We are amazed; and thus long have we stood</span>  
> <span id="3.3.75">To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,</span>  
>
> *To NORTHUMBERLAND*
>
> <span id="3.3.76">Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.77">And if we be, how dare thy joints forget</span>  
> <span id="3.3.78">To pay their awful duty to our presence?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.79">If we be not, show us the hand of God</span>  
> <span id="3.3.80">That hath dismissed us from our
> stewardship;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.81">For well we know, no hand of blood and bone</span>  
> <span id="3.3.82">Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.83">Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.84">And though you think that all, as you have
> done,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.85">Have torn their souls by turning them from
> us,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.86">And we are barren and bereft of friends;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.87">Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.88">Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf</span>  
> <span id="3.3.89">Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike</span>  
> <span id="3.3.90">Your children yet unborn and unbegot,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.91">That lift your vassal hands against my head</span>  
> <span id="3.3.92">And threat the glory of my precious crown.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.93">Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he
> stands--</span>  
> <span id="3.3.94">That every stride he makes upon my land</span>  
> <span id="3.3.95">Is dangerous treason: he is come to open</span>  
> <span id="3.3.96">The purple testament of bleeding war;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.97">But ere the crown he looks for live in
> peace,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.98">Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons</span>  
> <span id="3.3.99">Shall ill become the flower of England's
> face,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.100">Change the complexion of her maid-pale
> peace</span>  
> <span id="3.3.101">To scarlet indignation and bedew</span>  
> <span id="3.3.102">Her pastures' grass with faithful English
> blood.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="3.3.103">The king of heaven forbid our lord the
> king</span>  
> <span id="3.3.104">Should so with civil and uncivil arms</span>  
> <span id="3.3.105">Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin</span>  
> <span id="3.3.106">Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy
> hand;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.107">And by the honourable tomb he swears,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.108">That stands upon your royal grandsire's
> bones,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.109">And by the royalties of both your bloods,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.110">Currents that spring from one most gracious
> head,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.111">And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.112">And by the worth and honour of himself,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.113">Comprising all that may be sworn or said,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.114">His coming hither hath no further scope</span>  
> <span id="3.3.115">Than for his lineal royalties and to beg</span>  
> <span id="3.3.116">Enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.117">Which on thy royal party granted once,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.118">His glittering arms he will commend to
> rust,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.119">His barbed steeds to stables, and his
> heart</span>  
> <span id="3.3.120">To faithful service of your majesty.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.121">This swears he, as he is a prince, is
> just;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.122">And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.3.123">Northumberland, say thus the king returns:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.124">His noble cousin is right welcome hither;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.125">And all the number of his fair demands</span>  
> <span id="3.3.126">Shall be accomplish'd without
> contradiction:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.127">With all the gracious utterance thou hast</span>  
> <span id="3.3.128">Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.129">We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,</span>  
>
> *To DUKE OF AUMERLE*
>
> <span id="3.3.130">To look so poorly and to speak so fair?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.131">Shall we call back Northumberland, and
> send</span>  
> <span id="3.3.132">Defiance to the traitor, and so die?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="3.3.133">No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle
> words</span>  
> <span id="3.3.134">Till time lend friends and friends their helpful
> swords.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.3.135">O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of
> mine,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.136">That laid the sentence of dread banishment</span>  
> <span id="3.3.137">On yon proud man, should take it off again</span>  
> <span id="3.3.138">With words of sooth! O that I were as
> great</span>  
> <span id="3.3.139">As is my grief, or lesser than my name!</span>  
> <span id="3.3.140">Or that I could forget what I have been,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.141">Or not remember what I must be now!</span>  
> <span id="3.3.142">Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to
> beat,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.143">Since foes have scope to beat both thee and

<span id="speech20">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="3.3.144">Northumberland comes back from
> Bolingbroke.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.3.145">What must the king do now? must he submit?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.146">The king shall do it: must he be deposed?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.147">The king shall be contented: must he lose</span>  
> <span id="3.3.148">The name of king? o' God's name, let it
> go:</span>  
> <span id="3.3.149">I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.150">My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.151">My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.152">My figured goblets for a dish of wood,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.153">My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.154">My subjects for a pair of carved saints</span>  
> <span id="3.3.155">And my large kingdom for a little grave,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.156">A little little grave, an obscure grave;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.157">Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.158">Some way of common trade, where subjects'
> feet</span>  
> <span id="3.3.159">May hourly trample on their sovereign's
> head;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.160">For on my heart they tread now whilst I
> live;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.161">And buried once, why not upon my head?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.162">Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted
> cousin!</span>  
> <span id="3.3.163">We'll make foul weather with despised
> tears;</span>  
> <span id="3.3.164">Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer
> corn,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.165">And make a dearth in this revolting land.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.166">Or shall we play the wantons with our
> woes,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.167">And make some pretty match with shedding
> tears?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.168">As thus, to drop them still upon one
> place,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.169">Till they have fretted us a pair of graves</span>  
> <span id="3.3.170">Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there
> lies</span>  
> <span id="3.3.171">Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping
> eyes.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.172">Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I
> see</span>  
> <span id="3.3.173">I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.174">Most mighty prince, my Lord
> Northumberland,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.175">What says King Bolingbroke? will his
> majesty</span>  
> <span id="3.3.176">Give Richard leave to live till Richard
> die?</span>  
> <span id="3.3.177">You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="3.3.178">My lord, in the base court he doth attend</span>  
> <span id="3.3.179">To speak with you; may it please you to come
> down.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.3.180">Down, down I come; like glistering
> Phaethon,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.181">Wanting the manage of unruly jades.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.182">In the base court? Base court, where kings grow
> base,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.183">To come at traitors' calls and do them
> grace.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.184">In the base court? Come down? Down, court!</span>  
> <span id="3.3.185">down, king!</span>  
> <span id="3.3.186">For night-owls shriek where mounting larks</span>  
> <span id="3.3.187">should sing.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt from above*

<span id="speech24">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="3.3.188">What says his majesty?</span>  

<span id="speech25">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="3.3.189">Sorrow and grief of heart</span>  
> <span id="3.3.190">Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man</span>  
> <span id="3.3.191">Yet he is come.</span>  
>
> *Enter KING RICHARD and his attendants below*

<span id="speech26">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="3.3.192">Stand all apart,</span>

> *He kneels down*
>
> <span id="3.3.194">My gracious lord,--</span>  

<span id="speech27">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.3.195">Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee</span>  
> <span id="3.3.196">To make the base earth proud with kissing

> <span id="3.3.197">Me rather had my heart might feel your

> <span id="3.3.198">Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.199">Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.200">Thus high at least, although your knee be

<span id="speech28">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="3.3.201">My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

<span id="speech30">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="3.3.203">So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,</span>

<span id="speech31">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.3.205">Well you deserve: they well deserve to

> <span id="3.3.208">Tears show their love, but want their

> <span id="3.3.209">Cousin, I am too young to be your father,</span>  
> <span id="3.3.210">Though you are old enough to be my heir.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.211">What you will have, I'll give, and willing

> <span id="3.3.212">For do we must what force will have us do.</span>  
> <span id="3.3.213">Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?</span>  

<span id="speech32">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="3.3.214">Yea, my good lord.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.3.215">Then I must not say no.</span>
