## SCENE II

### The coast of Wales. A castle in view.

> *Drums; flourish and colours. Enter KING RICHARD II, the BISHOP OF
> CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, and Soldiers*

<span id="speech1">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.2.1">Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="3.2.2">Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.3">After your late tossing on the breaking
> seas?</span>  

<span id="speech3">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.2.4">Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy</span>  
> <span id="3.2.5">To stand upon my kingdom once again.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.6">Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.7">Though rebels wound thee with their horses'
> hoofs:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.8">As a long-parted mother with her child</span>  
> <span id="3.2.9">Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in
> meeting,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.10">So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my
> earth,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.11">And do thee favours with my royal hands.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.12">Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle
> earth,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.13">Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous
> sense;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.14">But let thy spiders, that suck up thy
> venom,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.15">And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.16">Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet</span>  
> <span id="3.2.17">Which with usurping steps do trample thee:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.18">Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.19">And when they from thy bosom pluck a
> flower,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.20">Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder</span>  
> <span id="3.2.21">Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch</span>  
> <span id="3.2.22">Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.23">Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.24">This earth shall have a feeling and these
> stones</span>  
> <span id="3.2.25">Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king</span>  
> <span id="3.2.26">Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**BISHOP OF CARLISLE**</span>

> <span id="3.2.27">Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you
> king</span>  
> <span id="3.2.28">Hath power to keep you king in spite of
> all.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.29">The means that heaven yields must be
> embraced,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.30">And not neglected; else, if heaven would,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.31">And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.32">The proffer'd means of succor and redress.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="3.2.33">He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.34">Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.35">Grows strong and great in substance and in
> power.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.2.36">Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not</span>  
> <span id="3.2.37">That when the searching eye of heaven is
> hid,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.38">Behind the globe, that lights the lower
> world,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.39">Then thieves and robbers range abroad
> unseen</span>  
> <span id="3.2.40">In murders and in outrage, boldly here;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.41">But when from under this terrestrial ball</span>  
> <span id="3.2.42">He fires the proud tops of the eastern
> pines</span>  
> <span id="3.2.43">And darts his light through every guilty
> hole,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.44">Then murders, treasons and detested sins,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.45">The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their
> backs,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.46">Stand bare and naked, trembling at
> themselves?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.47">So when this thief, this traitor,
> Bolingbroke,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.48">Who all this while hath revell'd in the
> night</span>  
> <span id="3.2.49">Whilst we were wandering with the
> antipodes,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.50">Shall see us rising in our throne, the
> east,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.51">His treasons will sit blushing in his face,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.52">Not able to endure the sight of day,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.53">But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.54">Not all the water in the rough rude sea</span>  
> <span id="3.2.55">Can wash the balm off from an anointed
> king;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.56">The breath of worldly men cannot depose</span>  
> <span id="3.2.57">The deputy elected by the Lord:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.58">For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd</span>  
> <span id="3.2.59">To lift shrewd steel against our golden
> crown,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.60">God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay</span>  
> <span id="3.2.61">A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.62">Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the
> right.</span>  
>
> *Enter EARL OF SALISBURY*
>
> <span id="3.2.63">Welcome, my lord how far off lies your
> power?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**EARL OF SALISBURY**</span>

> <span id="3.2.64">Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.65">Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my
> tongue</span>  
> <span id="3.2.66">And bids me speak of nothing but despair.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.67">One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.68">Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.69">O, call back yesterday, bid time return,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.70">And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting
> men!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.71">To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.72">O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy
> state:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.73">For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert
> dead.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.74">Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and
> fled.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="3.2.75">Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so
> pale?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.2.76">But now the blood of twenty thousand men</span>  
> <span id="3.2.77">Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.78">And, till so much blood thither come again,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.79">Have I not reason to look pale and dead?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.80">All souls that will be safe fly from my
> side,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.81">For time hath set a blot upon my pride.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="3.2.82">Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.2.83">I had forgot myself; am I not king?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.84">Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.85">Is not the king's name twenty thousand
> names?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.86">Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes</span>  
> <span id="3.2.87">At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.88">Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.89">High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York</span>  
> <span id="3.2.90">Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes
> here?</span>  
>
> *Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP*

<span id="speech12">**SIR STEPHEN SCROOP**</span>

> <span id="3.2.91">More health and happiness betide my liege</span>  
> <span id="3.2.92">Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!</span>  

<span id="speech13">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.2.93">Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.94">The worst is worldly loss thou canst
> unfold.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.95">Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care</span>  
> <span id="3.2.96">And what loss is it to be rid of care?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.97">Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.98">Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.99">We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.100">Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.101">They break their faith to God as well as
> us:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.102">Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.103">The worst is death, and death will have his
> day.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**SIR STEPHEN SCROOP**</span>

> <span id="3.2.104">Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd</span>  
> <span id="3.2.105">To bear the tidings of calamity.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.106">Like an unseasonable stormy day,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.107">Which makes the silver rivers drown their
> shores,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.108">As if the world were all dissolved to
> tears,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.109">So high above his limits swells the rage</span>  
> <span id="3.2.110">Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land</span>  
> <span id="3.2.111">With hard bright steel and hearts harder than
> steel.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.112">White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless
> scalps</span>  
> <span id="3.2.113">Against thy majesty; boys, with women's
> voices,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.114">Strive to speak big and clap their female
> joints</span>  
> <span id="3.2.115">In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.116">The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows</span>  
> <span id="3.2.117">Of double-fatal yew against thy state;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.118">Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills</span>  
> <span id="3.2.119">Against thy seat: both young and old
> rebel,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.120">And all goes worse than I have power to

<span id="speech15">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.2.121">Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so
> ill.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.122">Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is
> Bagot?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.123">What is become of Bushy? where is Green?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.124">That they have let the dangerous enemy</span>  
> <span id="3.2.125">Measure our confines with such peaceful

> <span id="3.2.126">If we prevail, their heads shall pay for

> <span id="3.2.127">I warrant they have made peace with
> Bolingbroke.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**SIR STEPHEN SCROOP**</span>

> <span id="3.2.128">Peace have they made with him indeed, my
> lord.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.2.129">O villains, vipers, damn'd without

> <span id="3.2.130">Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.131">Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my

> <span id="3.2.132">Three Judases, each one thrice worse than

> <span id="3.2.133">Would they make peace? terrible hell make

> <span id="3.2.134">Upon their spotted souls for this offence!</span>  

<span id="speech18">**SIR STEPHEN SCROOP**</span>

> <span id="3.2.135">Sweet love, I see, changing his property,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.136">Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.137">Again uncurse their souls; their peace is

> <span id="3.2.138">With heads, and not with hands; those whom you

> <span id="3.2.139">Have felt the worst of death's destroying

> <span id="3.2.140">And lie full low, graved in the hollow

<span id="speech19">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="3.2.141">Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire
> dead?</span>  

<span id="speech20">**SIR STEPHEN SCROOP**</span>

> <span id="3.2.142">Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their

<span id="speech21">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="3.2.143">Where is the duke my father with his

<span id="speech22">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="3.2.144">No matter where; of comfort no man speak:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.145">Let's talk of graves, of worms, and

> <span id="3.2.146">Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes</span>  
> <span id="3.2.147">Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.148">Let's choose executors and talk of wills:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.149">And yet not so, for what can we bequeath</span>  
> <span id="3.2.150">Save our deposed bodies to the ground?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.151">Our lands, our lives and all are
> Bolingbroke's,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.152">And nothing can we call our own but death</span>  
> <span id="3.2.153">And that small model of the barren earth</span>

> <span id="3.2.155">For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground</span>  
> <span id="3.2.156">And tell sad stories of the death of

> <span id="3.2.157">How some have been deposed; some slain in

> <span id="3.2.158">Some haunted by the ghosts they have

> <span id="3.2.159">Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping

> <span id="3.2.160">All murder'd: for within the hollow crown</span>  
> <span id="3.2.161">That rounds the mortal temples of a king</span>  
> <span id="3.2.162">Keeps Death his court and there the antic
> sits,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.163">Scoffing his state and grinning at his

> <span id="3.2.164">Allowing him a breath, a little scene,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.165">To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with
> looks,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.166">Infusing him with self and vain conceit,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.167">As if this flesh which walls about our

> <span id="3.2.168">Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus</span>  
> <span id="3.2.169">Comes at the last and with a little pin</span>

> <span id="3.2.171">Cover your heads and mock not flesh and

> <span id="3.2.172">With solemn reverence: throw away respect,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.173">Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,</span>

<span id="speech23">**BISHOP OF CARLISLE**</span>

> <span id="3.2.178">My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their

> <span id="3.2.179">But presently prevent the ways to wail.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.180">To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth

<span id="speech26">**SIR STEPHEN SCROOP**</span>
