<span id="speech1">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.1">Bring forth these men.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.2">Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--</span>  
> <span id="3.1.3">Since presently your souls must part your
> bodies--</span>  
> <span id="3.1.4">With too much urging your pernicious lives,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.5">For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your
> blood</span>  
> <span id="3.1.6">From off my hands, here in the view of men</span>  
> <span id="3.1.7">I will unfold some causes of your deaths.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.8">You have misled a prince, a royal king,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.9">A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.10">By you unhappied and disfigured clean:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.11">You have in manner with your sinful hours</span>  
> <span id="3.1.12">Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.13">Broke the possession of a royal bed</span>  
> <span id="3.1.14">And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's
> cheeks</span>  
> <span id="3.1.15">With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul
> wrongs.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.16">Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.17">Near to the king in blood, and near in love</span>  
> <span id="3.1.18">Till you did make him misinterpret me,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.19">Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.20">And sigh'd my English breath in foreign
> clouds,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.21">Eating the bitter bread of banishment;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.22">Whilst you have fed upon my signories,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.23">Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest
> woods,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.24">From my own windows torn my household coat,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.25">Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.26">Save men's opinions and my living blood,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.27">To show the world I am a gentleman.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.28">This and much more, much more than twice all
> this,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.29">Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd
> over</span>  
> <span id="3.1.30">To execution and the hand of death.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**BUSHY**</span>

> <span id="3.1.31">More welcome is the stroke of death to me</span>  
> <span id="3.1.32">Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords,
> farewell.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**GREEN**</span>

> <span id="3.1.33">My comfort is that heaven will take our
> souls</span>  
> <span id="3.1.34">And plague injustice with the pains of
> hell.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.35">My Lord Northumberland, see them
> dispatch'd.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND and others, with the prisoners*
>
> <span id="3.1.36">Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.37">For God's sake, fairly let her be
> entreated:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.38">Tell her I send to her my kind commends;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.39">Take special care my greetings be
> deliver'd.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="3.1.40">A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd</span>  
> <span id="3.1.41">With letters of your love to her at large.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.42">Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.43">To fight with Glendower and his complices:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.44">Awhile to work, and after holiday.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
