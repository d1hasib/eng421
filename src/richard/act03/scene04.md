## SCENE IV

### LANGLEY. The DUKE OF YORK's garden.

> *Enter the QUEEN and two Ladies*

<span id="speech1">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="3.4.1">What sport shall we devise here in this
> garden,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.2">To drive away the heavy thought of care?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Lady**</span>

> <span id="3.4.3">Madam, we'll play at bowls.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="3.4.4">'Twill make me think the world is full of
> rubs,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.5">And that my fortune rubs against the bias.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Lady**</span>

> <span id="3.4.6">Madam, we'll dance.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="3.4.7">My legs can keep no measure in delight,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.8">When my poor heart no measure keeps in
> grief:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.9">Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other
> sport.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Lady**</span>

> <span id="3.4.10">Madam, we'll tell tales.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="3.4.11">Of sorrow or of joy?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**Lady**</span>

> <span id="3.4.12">Of either, madam.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="3.4.13">Of neither, girl:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.14">For of joy, being altogether wanting,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.15">It doth remember me the more of sorrow;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.16">Or if of grief, being altogether had,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.17">It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.18">For what I have I need not to repeat;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.19">And what I want it boots not to complain.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**Lady**</span>

> <span id="3.4.20">Madam, I'll sing.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="3.4.21">'Tis well that thou hast cause</span>  
> <span id="3.4.22">But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou
> weep.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**Lady**</span>

> <span id="3.4.23">I could weep, madam, would it do you good.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="3.4.24">And I could sing, would weeping do me good,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.25">And never borrow any tear of thee.</span>  
>
> *Enter a Gardener, and two Servants*
>
> <span id="3.4.26">But stay, here come the gardeners:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.27">Let's step into the shadow of these trees.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.28">My wretchedness unto a row of pins,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.29">They'll talk of state; for every one doth
> so</span>  
> <span id="3.4.30">Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.</span>  
>
> *QUEEN and Ladies retire*

<span id="speech14">**Gardener**</span>

> <span id="3.4.31">Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.32">Which, like unruly children, make their
> sire</span>  
> <span id="3.4.33">Stoop with oppression of their prodigal
> weight:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.34">Give some supportance to the bending twigs.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.35">Go thou, and like an executioner,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.36">Cut off the heads of too fast growing
> sprays,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.37">That look too lofty in our commonwealth:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.38">All must be even in our government.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.39">You thus employ'd, I will go root away</span>  
> <span id="3.4.40">The noisome weeds, which without profit
> suck</span>  
> <span id="3.4.41">The soil's fertility from wholesome
> flowers.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="3.4.42">Why should we in the compass of a pale</span>  
> <span id="3.4.43">Keep law and form and due proportion,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.44">Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.45">When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.46">Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked
> up,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.47">Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges
> ruin'd,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.48">Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome
> herbs</span>  
> <span id="3.4.49">Swarming with caterpillars?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**Gardener**</span>

> <span id="3.4.50">Hold thy peace:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.51">He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd
> spring</span>  
> <span id="3.4.52">Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.53">The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did
> shelter,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.54">That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.55">Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.56">I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="3.4.57">What, are they dead?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**Gardener**</span>

> <span id="3.4.58">They are; and Bolingbroke</span>  
> <span id="3.4.59">Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is
> it</span>  
> <span id="3.4.60">That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his
> land</span>  
> <span id="3.4.61">As we this garden! We at time of year</span>  
> <span id="3.4.62">Do wound the bark, the skin of our
> fruit-trees,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.63">Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.64">With too much riches it confound itself:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.65">Had he done so to great and growing men,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.66">They might have lived to bear and he to
> taste</span>  
> <span id="3.4.67">Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches</span>  
> <span id="3.4.68">We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.69">Had he done so, himself had borne the
> crown,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.70">Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown
> down.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="3.4.71">What, think you then the king shall be
> deposed?</span>  

<span id="speech20">**Gardener**</span>

> <span id="3.4.72">Depress'd he is already, and deposed</span>  
> <span id="3.4.73">'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last
> night</span>  
> <span id="3.4.74">To a dear friend of the good Duke of
> York's,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.75">That tell black tidings.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="3.4.76">O, I am press'd to death through want of
> speaking!</span>  
>
> *Coming forward*
>
> <span id="3.4.77">Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this
> garden,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.78">How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this
> unpleasing news?</span>  
> <span id="3.4.79">What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee</span>  
> <span id="3.4.80">To make a second fall of cursed man?</span>  
> <span id="3.4.81">Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?</span>  
> <span id="3.4.82">Darest thou, thou little better thing than
> earth,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.83">Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and
> how,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.84">Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou
> wretch.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**Gardener**</span>

> <span id="3.4.85">Pardon me, madam: little joy have I</span>  
> <span id="3.4.86">To breathe this news; yet what I say is
> true.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.87">King Richard, he is in the mighty hold</span>  
> <span id="3.4.88">Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are
> weigh'd:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.89">In your lord's scale is nothing but
> himself,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.90">And some few vanities that make him light;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.91">But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.92">Besides himself, are all the English peers,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.93">And with that odds he weighs King Richard
> down.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.94">Post you to London, and you will find it
> so;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.95">I speak no more than every one doth know.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="3.4.96">Nimble mischance, that art so light of
> foot,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.97">Doth not thy embassage belong to me,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.98">And am I last that knows it? O, thou
> think'st</span>  
> <span id="3.4.99">To serve me last, that I may longest keep</span>  
> <span id="3.4.100">Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.101">To meet at London London's king in woe.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.102">What, was I born to this, that my sad look</span>  
> <span id="3.4.103">Should grace the triumph of great
> Bolingbroke?</span>  
> <span id="3.4.104">Gardener, for telling me these news of
> woe,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.105">Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never
> grow.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies*

<span id="speech24">**GARDENER**</span>

> <span id="3.4.106">Poor queen! so that thy state might be no
> worse,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.107">I would my skill were subject to thy
> curse.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.108">Here did she fall a tear; here in this
> place</span>  
> <span id="3.4.109">I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of
> grace:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.110">Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be
> seen,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.111">In the remembrance of a weeping queen.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
