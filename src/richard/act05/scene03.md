## SCENE III

### A royal palace.

> *Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, HENRY PERCY, and other Lords*

<span id="speech1">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.1">Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?</span>  
> <span id="5.3.2">'Tis full three months since I did see him
> last;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.3">If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.4">I would to God, my lords, he might be found:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.5">Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns
> there,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.6">For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.7">With unrestrained loose companions,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.8">Even such, they say, as stand in narrow
> lanes,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.9">And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.10">Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.11">Takes on the point of honour to support</span>  
> <span id="5.3.12">So dissolute a crew.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**HENRY PERCY**</span>

> <span id="5.3.13">My lord, some two days since I saw the
> prince,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.14">And told him of those triumphs held at
> Oxford.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.15">And what said the gallant?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**HENRY PERCY**</span>

> <span id="5.3.16">His answer was, he would unto the stews,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.17">And from the common'st creature pluck a
> glove,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.18">And wear it as a favour; and with that</span>  
> <span id="5.3.19">He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.20">As dissolute as desperate; yet through both</span>  
> <span id="5.3.21">I see some sparks of better hope, which elder
> years</span>  
> <span id="5.3.22">May happily bring forth. But who comes
> here?</span>  
>
> *Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE*

<span id="speech6">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.23">Where is the king?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.24">What means our cousin, that he stares and
> looks</span>  
> <span id="5.3.25">So wildly?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.26">God save your grace! I do beseech your
> majesty,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.27">To have some conference with your grace
> alone.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.28">Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here
> alone.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt HENRY PERCY and Lords*
>
> <span id="5.3.29">What is the matter with our cousin now?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.30">For ever may my knees grow to the earth,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.31">My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth</span>  
> <span id="5.3.32">Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.33">Intended or committed was this fault?</span>  
> <span id="5.3.34">If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.35">To win thy after-love I pardon thee.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.36">Then give me leave that I may turn the key,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.37">That no man enter till my tale be done.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.38">Have thy desire.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.39">\[Within\] My liege, beware; look to
> thyself;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.40">Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.41">Villain, I'll make thee safe.</span>  
>
> *Drawing*

<span id="speech16">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.42">Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to
> fear.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.43">\[Within\] Open the door, secure, foolhardy
> king:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.44">Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?</span>  
> <span id="5.3.45">Open the door, or I will break it open.</span>  
>
> *Enter DUKE OF YORK*

<span id="speech18">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.46">What is the matter, uncle? speak;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.47">Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.48">That we may arm us to encounter it.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.49">Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt
> know</span>  
> <span id="5.3.50">The treason that my haste forbids me show.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.51">Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise
> pass'd:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.52">I do repent me; read not my name there</span>  
> <span id="5.3.53">My heart is not confederate with my hand.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.54">It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it
> down.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.55">I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.56">Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.57">Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove</span>  
> <span id="5.3.58">A serpent that will sting thee to the
> heart.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.59">O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!</span>  
> <span id="5.3.60">O loyal father of a treacherous son!</span>  
> <span id="5.3.61">Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.62">From when this stream through muddy
> passages</span>  
> <span id="5.3.63">Hath held his current and defiled himself!</span>  
> <span id="5.3.64">Thy overflow of good converts to bad,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.65">And thy abundant goodness shall excuse</span>  
> <span id="5.3.66">This deadly blot in thy digressing son.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.67">So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.68">And he shall spend mine honour with his
> shame,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.69">As thriftless sons their scraping fathers'
> gold.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.70">Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.71">Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.72">Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him
> breath,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.73">The traitor lives, the true man's put to
> death.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.74">\[Within\] What ho, my liege! for God's
> sake,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.75">let me in.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.76">What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager
> cry?</span>  

<span id="speech26">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.77">A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.78">Speak with me, pity me, open the door.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.79">A beggar begs that never begg'd before.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.80">Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.81">And now changed to 'The Beggar and the
> King.'</span>  
> <span id="5.3.82">My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.83">I know she is come to pray for your foul
> sin.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.84">If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.85">More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.86">This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest
> sound;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.87">This let alone will all the rest confound.</span>  
>
> *Enter DUCHESS OF YORK*

<span id="speech29">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.88">O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!</span>  
> <span id="5.3.89">Love loving not itself none other can.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.90">Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make
> here?</span>  
> <span id="5.3.91">Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor
> rear?</span>  

<span id="speech31">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.92">Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle
> liege.</span>  
>
> *Kneels*

<span id="speech32">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.93">Rise up, good aunt.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.94">Not yet, I thee beseech:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.95">For ever will I walk upon my knees,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.96">And never see day that the happy sees,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.97">Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.98">By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.99">Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.100">Against them both my true joints bended
> be.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.101">Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any
> grace!</span>  

<span id="speech36">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.102">Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.103">His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in
> jest;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.104">His words come from his mouth, ours from our
> breast:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.105">He prays but faintly and would be denied;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.106">We pray with heart and soul and all
> beside:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.107">His weary joints would gladly rise, I
> know;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.108">Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they
> grow:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.109">His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.110">Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.111">Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them
> have</span>  
> <span id="5.3.112">That mercy which true prayer ought to
> have.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.113">Good aunt, stand up.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.114">Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'</span>  
> <span id="5.3.115">Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand
> up.'</span>  
> <span id="5.3.116">And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to
> teach,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.117">'Pardon' should be the first word of thy
> speech.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.118">I never long'd to hear a word till now;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.119">Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee
> how:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.120">The word is short, but not so short as
> sweet;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.121">No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so
> meet.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.122">Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne
> moi.'</span>  

<span id="speech40">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.123">Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?</span>  
> <span id="5.3.124">Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.125">That set'st the word itself against the
> word!</span>  
> <span id="5.3.126">Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our
> land;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.127">The chopping French we do not understand.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.128">Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue
> there;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.129">Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine
> ear;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.130">That hearing how our plaints and prayers do
> pierce,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.131">Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.132">Good aunt, stand up.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.133">I do not sue to stand;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.134">Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.135">I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.</span>  

<span id="speech44">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.136">O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!</span>  
> <span id="5.3.137">Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.138">Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon
> twain,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.139">But makes one pardon strong.</span>  

<span id="speech45">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.140">With all my heart</span>  
> <span id="5.3.141">I pardon him.</span>  

<span id="speech46">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.142">A god on earth thou art.</span>  

<span id="speech47">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.3.143">But for our trusty brother-in-law and the
> abbot,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.144">With all the rest of that consorted crew,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.145">Destruction straight shall dog them at the
> heels.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.146">Good uncle, help to order several powers</span>  
> <span id="5.3.147">To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.148">They shall not live within this world, I
> swear,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.149">But I will have them, if I once know
> where.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.150">Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.151">Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you
> true.</span>  

<span id="speech48">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.3.152">Come, my old son: I pray God make thee
> new.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
