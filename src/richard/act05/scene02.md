## SCENE II

### The DUKE OF YORK's palace.

> *Enter DUKE OF YORK and DUCHESS OF YORK*

<span id="speech1">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.1">My lord, you told me you would tell the
> rest,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.2">When weeping made you break the story off,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.3">of our two cousins coming into London.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.4">Where did I leave?</span>  

<span id="speech3">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.5">At that sad stop, my lord,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.6">Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows'
> tops</span>  
> <span id="5.2.7">Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's
> head.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.8">Then, as I said, the duke, great
> Bolingbroke,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.9">Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed</span>  
> <span id="5.2.10">Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.11">With slow but stately pace kept on his
> course,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.12">Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.13">Bolingbroke!'</span>  
> <span id="5.2.14">You would have thought the very windows
> spake,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.15">So many greedy looks of young and old</span>  
> <span id="5.2.16">Through casements darted their desiring
> eyes</span>  
> <span id="5.2.17">Upon his visage, and that all the walls</span>  
> <span id="5.2.18">With painted imagery had said at once</span>  
> <span id="5.2.19">'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'</span>  
> <span id="5.2.20">Whilst he, from the one side to the other
> turning,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.21">Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's
> neck,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.22">Bespake them thus: 'I thank you,
> countrymen:'</span>  
> <span id="5.2.23">And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.24">Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the
> whilst?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.25">As in a theatre, the eyes of men,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.26">After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.27">Are idly bent on him that enters next,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.28">Thinking his prattle to be tedious;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.29">Even so, or with much more contempt, men's
> eyes</span>  
> <span id="5.2.30">Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save
> him!'</span>  
> <span id="5.2.31">No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.32">But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.33">Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.34">His face still combating with tears and
> smiles,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.35">The badges of his grief and patience,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.36">That had not God, for some strong purpose,
> steel'd</span>  
> <span id="5.2.37">The hearts of men, they must perforce have
> melted</span>  
> <span id="5.2.38">And barbarism itself have pitied him.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.39">But heaven hath a hand in these events,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.40">To whose high will we bound our calm
> contents.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.41">To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.42">Whose state and honour I for aye allow.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.43">Here comes my son Aumerle.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.44">Aumerle that was;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.45">But that is lost for being Richard's
> friend,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.46">And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.47">I am in parliament pledge for his truth</span>  
> <span id="5.2.48">And lasting fealty to the new-made king.</span>  
>
> *Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE*

<span id="speech9">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.49">Welcome, my son: who are the violets now</span>  
> <span id="5.2.50">That strew the green lap of the new come
> spring?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.2.51">Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.52">God knows I had as lief be none as one.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.53">Well, bear you well in this new spring of
> time,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.54">Lest you be cropp'd before you come to
> prime.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.55">What news from Oxford? hold those justs and
> triumphs?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.2.56">For aught I know, my lord, they do.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.57">You will be there, I know.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.2.58">If God prevent not, I purpose so.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.59">What seal is that, that hangs without thy
> bosom?</span>  
> <span id="5.2.60">Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the
> writing.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.2.61">My lord, 'tis nothing.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.62">No matter, then, who see it;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.63">I will be satisfied; let me see the
> writing.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.2.64">I do beseech your grace to pardon me:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.65">It is a matter of small consequence,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.66">Which for some reasons I would not have
> seen.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.67">Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.68">I fear, I fear,--</span>  

<span id="speech20">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.69">What should you fear?</span>  
> <span id="5.2.70">'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd
> into</span>  
> <span id="5.2.71">For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.72">Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond</span>  
> <span id="5.2.73">That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.74">Boy, let me see the writing.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.2.75">I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show
> it.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.76">I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.</span>  
>
> *He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it*
>
> <span id="5.2.77">Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor!
> slave!</span>  

<span id="speech24">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.78">What is the matter, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech25">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.79">Ho! who is within there?</span>  
>
> *Enter a Servant*
>
> <span id="5.2.80">Saddle my horse.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.81">God for his mercy, what treachery is here!</span>  

<span id="speech26">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.82">Why, what is it, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.83">Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.84">Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my
> troth,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.85">I will appeach the villain.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.86">What is the matter?</span>  

<span id="speech29">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.87">Peace, foolish woman.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.88">I will not peace. What is the matter,
> Aumerle.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**DUKE OF AUMERLE**</span>

> <span id="5.2.89">Good mother, be content; it is no more</span>  
> <span id="5.2.90">Than my poor life must answer.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.91">Thy life answer!</span>  

<span id="speech33">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.92">Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter Servant with boots*

<span id="speech34">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.93">Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art
> amazed.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.94">Hence, villain! never more come in my
> sight.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.95">Give me my boots, I say.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.96">Why, York, what wilt thou do?</span>  
> <span id="5.2.97">Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine
> own?</span>  
> <span id="5.2.98">Have we more sons? or are we like to have?</span>  
> <span id="5.2.99">Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?</span>  
> <span id="5.2.100">And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine
> age,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.101">And rob me of a happy mother's name?</span>  
> <span id="5.2.102">Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?</span>  

<span id="speech37">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.103">Thou fond mad woman,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.104">Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?</span>  
> <span id="5.2.105">A dozen of them here have ta'en the
> sacrament,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.106">And interchangeably set down their hands,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.107">To kill the king at Oxford.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.108">He shall be none;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.109">We'll keep him here: then what is that to
> him?</span>  

<span id="speech39">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.110">Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my
> son,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.111">I would appeach him.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.112">Hadst thou groan'd for him</span>  
> <span id="5.2.113">As I have done, thou wouldst be more
> pitiful.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.114">But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect</span>  
> <span id="5.2.115">That I have been disloyal to thy bed,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.116">And that he is a bastard, not thy son:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.117">Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that
> mind:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.118">He is as like thee as a man may be,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.119">Not like to me, or any of my kin,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.120">And yet I love him.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**DUKE OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.121">Make way, unruly woman!</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech42">**DUCHESS OF YORK**</span>

> <span id="5.2.122">After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.123">Spur post, and get before him to the king,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.124">And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.125">I'll not be long behind; though I be old,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.126">I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.127">And never will I rise up from the ground</span>  
> <span id="5.2.128">Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be
> gone!</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
