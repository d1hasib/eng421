### Windsor castle.

> *Flourish. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK, with other Lords,

<span id="speech1">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.6.1">Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear</span>  
> <span id="5.6.2">Is that the rebels have consumed with fire</span>  
> <span id="5.6.3">Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;</span>  
> <span id="5.6.4">But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear
> not.</span>  
>
> *Enter NORTHUMBERLAND*
>
> <span id="5.6.5">Welcome, my lord what is the news?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="5.6.6">First, to thy sacred state wish I all
> happiness.</span>  
> <span id="5.6.7">The next news is, I have to London sent</span>  
> <span id="5.6.8">The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and
> Kent:</span>  
> <span id="5.6.9">The manner of their taking may appear</span>  
> <span id="5.6.10">At large discoursed in this paper here.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.6.11">We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;</span>  
> <span id="5.6.12">And to thy worth will add right worthy
> gains.</span>  
>
> *Enter LORD FITZWATER*

<span id="speech4">**LORD FITZWATER**</span>

> <span id="5.6.13">My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London</span>  
> <span id="5.6.14">The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,</span>  
> <span id="5.6.15">Two of the dangerous consorted traitors</span>  
> <span id="5.6.16">That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.6.17">Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;</span>  
> <span id="5.6.18">Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.</span>  
>
> *Enter HENRY PERCY, and the BISHOP OF CARLISLE*

<span id="speech6">**HENRY PERCY**</span>

> <span id="5.6.19">The grand conspirator, Abbot of
> Westminster,</span>  
> <span id="5.6.20">With clog of conscience and sour melancholy</span>  
> <span id="5.6.21">Hath yielded up his body to the grave;</span>  
> <span id="5.6.22">But here is Carlisle living, to abide</span>  
> <span id="5.6.23">Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.6.24">Carlisle, this is your doom:</span>  
> <span id="5.6.25">Choose out some secret place, some reverend
> room,</span>  
> <span id="5.6.26">More than thou hast, and with it joy thy
> life;</span>  
> <span id="5.6.27">So as thou livest in peace, die free from
> strife:</span>  
> <span id="5.6.28">For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,</span>  
> <span id="5.6.29">High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.</span>  
>
> *Enter EXTON, with persons bearing a coffin*

<span id="speech8">**EXTON**</span>

> <span id="5.6.30">Great king, within this coffin I present</span>  
> <span id="5.6.31">Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies</span>  
> <span id="5.6.32">The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,</span>  
> <span id="5.6.33">Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.6.34">Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast
> wrought</span>  
> <span id="5.6.35">A deed of slander with thy fatal hand</span>  
> <span id="5.6.36">Upon my head and all this famous land.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**EXTON**</span>

> <span id="5.6.37">From your own mouth, my lord, did I this
> deed.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**HENRY BOLINGBROKE**</span>

> <span id="5.6.38">They love not poison that do poison need,</span>  
> <span id="5.6.39">Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,</span>  
> <span id="5.6.40">I hate the murderer, love him murdered.</span>  
> <span id="5.6.41">The guilt of conscience take thou for thy
> labour,</span>  
> <span id="5.6.42">But neither my good word nor princely
> favour:</span>  
> <span id="5.6.43">With Cain go wander through shades of
> night,</span>  
> <span id="5.6.44">And never show thy head by day nor light.</span>  
> <span id="5.6.45">Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,</span>  
> <span id="5.6.46">That blood should sprinkle me to make me
> grow:</span>  
> <span id="5.6.47">Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,</span>  
> <span id="5.6.48">And put on sullen black incontinent:</span>  
> <span id="5.6.49">I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,</span>  
> <span id="5.6.50">To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:</span>  
> <span id="5.6.51">March sadly after; grace my mournings here;</span>  
> <span id="5.6.52">In weeping after this untimely bier.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
