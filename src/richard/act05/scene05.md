## SCENE V

### Pomfret castle.

> *Enter KING RICHARD*

<span id="speech1">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.5.1">I have been studying how I may compare</span>  
> <span id="5.5.2">This prison where I live unto the world:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.3">And for because the world is populous</span>  
> <span id="5.5.4">And here is not a creature but myself,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.5">I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.6">My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.7">My soul the father; and these two beget</span>  
> <span id="5.5.8">A generation of still-breeding thoughts,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.9">And these same thoughts people this little
> world,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.10">In humours like the people of this world,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.11">For no thought is contented. The better
> sort,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.12">As thoughts of things divine, are
> intermix'd</span>  
> <span id="5.5.13">With scruples and do set the word itself</span>  
> <span id="5.5.14">Against the word:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.15">As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then
> again,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.16">'It is as hard to come as for a camel</span>  
> <span id="5.5.17">To thread the postern of a small needle's
> eye.'</span>  
> <span id="5.5.18">Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</span>  
> <span id="5.5.19">Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails</span>  
> <span id="5.5.20">May tear a passage through the flinty ribs</span>  
> <span id="5.5.21">Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.22">And, for they cannot, die in their own
> pride.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.23">Thoughts tending to content flatter
> themselves</span>  
> <span id="5.5.24">That they are not the first of fortune's
> slaves,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.25">Nor shall not be the last; like silly
> beggars</span>  
> <span id="5.5.26">Who sitting in the stocks refuge their
> shame,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.27">That many have and others must sit there;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.28">And in this thought they find a kind of
> ease,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.29">Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</span>  
> <span id="5.5.30">Of such as have before endured the like.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.31">Thus play I in one person many people,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.32">And none contented: sometimes am I king;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.33">Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.34">And so I am: then crushing penury</span>  
> <span id="5.5.35">Persuades me I was better when a king;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.36">Then am I king'd again: and by and by</span>  
> <span id="5.5.37">Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.38">And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.39">Nor I nor any man that but man is</span>  
> <span id="5.5.40">With nothing shall be pleased, till he be
> eased</span>  
> <span id="5.5.41">With being nothing. Music do I hear?</span>  
>
> *Music*
>
> <span id="5.5.42">Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.43">When time is broke and no proportion kept!</span>  
> <span id="5.5.44">So is it in the music of men's lives.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.45">And here have I the daintiness of ear</span>  
> <span id="5.5.46">To cheque time broke in a disorder'd
> string;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.47">But for the concord of my state and time</span>  
> <span id="5.5.48">Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.49">I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.50">For now hath time made me his numbering
> clock:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.51">My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they
> jar</span>  
> <span id="5.5.52">Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward
> watch,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.53">Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.54">Is pointing still, in cleansing them from
> tears.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.55">Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it
> is</span>  
> <span id="5.5.56">Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my
> heart,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.57">Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and
> groans</span>  
> <span id="5.5.58">Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time</span>  
> <span id="5.5.59">Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.60">While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the
> clock.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.61">This music mads me; let it sound no more;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.62">For though it have holp madmen to their
> wits,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.63">In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.64">Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</span>  
> <span id="5.5.65">For 'tis a sign of love; and love to
> Richard</span>  
> <span id="5.5.66">Is a strange brooch in this all-hating
> world.</span>  
>
> *Enter a Groom of the Stable*

<span id="speech2">**Groom**</span>

> <span id="5.5.67">Hail, royal prince!</span>  

<span id="speech3">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.5.68">Thanks, noble peer;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.69">The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.70">What art thou? and how comest thou hither,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.71">Where no man never comes but that sad dog</span>  
> <span id="5.5.72">That brings me food to make misfortune
> live?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Groom**</span>

> <span id="5.5.73">I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.74">When thou wert king; who, travelling towards
> York,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.75">With much ado at length have gotten leave</span>  
> <span id="5.5.76">To look upon my sometimes royal master's
> face.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.77">O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld</span>  
> <span id="5.5.78">In London streets, that coronation-day,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.79">When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.80">That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.81">That horse that I so carefully have
> dress'd!</span>  

<span id="speech5">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.5.82">Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.83">How went he under him?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Groom**</span>

> <span id="5.5.84">So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.5.85">So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!</span>  
> <span id="5.5.86">That jade hath eat bread from my royal
> hand;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.87">This hand hath made him proud with clapping
> him.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.88">Would he not stumble? would he not fall
> down,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.89">Since pride must have a fall, and break the
> neck</span>  
> <span id="5.5.90">Of that proud man that did usurp his back?</span>  
> <span id="5.5.91">Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.92">Since thou, created to be awed by man,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.93">Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.94">And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.95">Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing
> Bolingbroke.</span>  
>
> *Enter Keeper, with a dish*

<span id="speech8">**Keeper**</span>

> <span id="5.5.96">Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.5.97">If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**Groom**</span>

> <span id="5.5.98">What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall
> say.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech11">**Keeper**</span>

> <span id="5.5.99">My lord, will't please you to fall to?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.5.100">Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**Keeper**</span>

> <span id="5.5.101">My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton,
> who</span>  
> <span id="5.5.102">lately came from the king, commands the
> contrary.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.5.103">The devil take Henry of Lancaster and
> thee!</span>  
> <span id="5.5.104">Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.</span>  
>
> *Beats the keeper*

<span id="speech15">**Keeper**</span>

> <span id="5.5.105">Help, help, help!</span>  
>
> *Enter EXTON and Servants, armed*

<span id="speech16">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.5.106">How now! what means death in this rude
> assault?</span>  
> <span id="5.5.107">Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's
> instrument.</span>  
>
> *Snatching an axe from a Servant and killing him*
>
> <span id="5.5.108">Go thou, and fill another room in hell.</span>  
>
> *He kills another. Then Exton strikes him down*
>
> <span id="5.5.109">That hand shall burn in never-quenching
> fire</span>  
> <span id="5.5.110">That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce
> hand</span>  
> <span id="5.5.111">Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own
> land.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.112">Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on
> high;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.113">Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to
> die.</span>  
>
> *Dies*

<span id="speech17">**EXTON**</span>

> <span id="5.5.114">As full of valour as of royal blood:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.115">Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were
> good!</span>  
> <span id="5.5.116">For now the devil, that told me I did
> well,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.117">Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.118">This dead king to the living king I'll
> bear</span>  
> <span id="5.5.119">Take hence the rest, and give them burial
> here.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
