## SCENE I

### London. A street leading to the Tower.

> *Enter QUEEN and Ladies*

<span id="speech1">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="5.1.1">This way the king will come; this is the way</span>  
> <span id="5.1.2">To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.3">To whose flint bosom my condemned lord</span>  
> <span id="5.1.4">Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.5">Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth</span>  
> <span id="5.1.6">Have any resting for her true king's queen.</span>  
>
> *Enter KING RICHARD II and Guard*
>
> <span id="5.1.7">But soft, but see, or rather do not see,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.8">My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.9">That you in pity may dissolve to dew,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.10">And wash him fresh again with true-love
> tears.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.11">Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did
> stand,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.12">Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's
> tomb,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.13">And not King Richard; thou most beauteous
> inn,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.14">Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in
> thee,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.15">When triumph is become an alehouse guest?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.1.16">Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.17">To make my end too sudden: learn, good
> soul,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.18">To think our former state a happy dream;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.19">From which awaked, the truth of what we are</span>  
> <span id="5.1.20">Shows us but this: I am sworn brother,
> sweet,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.21">To grim Necessity, and he and I</span>  
> <span id="5.1.22">Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to
> France</span>  
> <span id="5.1.23">And cloister thee in some religious house:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.24">Our holy lives must win a new world's
> crown,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.25">Which our profane hours here have stricken
> down.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="5.1.26">What, is my Richard both in shape and mind</span>  
> <span id="5.1.27">Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke
> deposed</span>  
> <span id="5.1.28">Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?</span>  
> <span id="5.1.29">The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.30">And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with
> rage</span>  
> <span id="5.1.31">To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou,
> pupil-like,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.32">Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.33">And fawn on rage with base humility,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.34">Which art a lion and a king of beasts?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.1.35">A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but
> beasts,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.36">I had been still a happy king of men.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.37">Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for
> France:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.38">Think I am dead and that even here thou
> takest,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.39">As from my death-bed, thy last living
> leave.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.40">In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire</span>  
> <span id="5.1.41">With good old folks and let them tell thee
> tales</span>  
> <span id="5.1.42">Of woeful ages long ago betid;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.43">And ere thou bid good night, to quit their
> griefs,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.44">Tell thou the lamentable tale of me</span>  
> <span id="5.1.45">And send the hearers weeping to their beds:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.46">For why, the senseless brands will
> sympathize</span>  
> <span id="5.1.47">The heavy accent of thy moving tongue</span>  
> <span id="5.1.48">And in compassion weep the fire out;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.49">And some will mourn in ashes, some
> coal-black,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.50">For the deposing of a rightful king.</span>  
>
> *Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others*

<span id="speech5">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="5.1.51">My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is
> changed:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.52">You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.53">And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.54">With all swift speed you must away to
> France.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.1.55">Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal</span>  
> <span id="5.1.56">The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.57">The time shall not be many hours of age</span>  
> <span id="5.1.58">More than it is ere foul sin gathering head</span>  
> <span id="5.1.59">Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt
> think,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.60">Though he divide the realm and give thee
> half,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.61">It is too little, helping him to all;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.62">And he shall think that thou, which know'st the
> way</span>  
> <span id="5.1.63">To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.64">Being ne'er so little urged, another way</span>  
> <span id="5.1.65">To pluck him headlong from the usurped
> throne.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.66">The love of wicked men converts to fear;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.67">That fear to hate, and hate turns one or
> both</span>  
> <span id="5.1.68">To worthy danger and deserved death.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="5.1.69">My guilt be on my head, and there an end.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.70">Take leave and part; for you must part
> forthwith.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.1.71">Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate</span>  
> <span id="5.1.72">A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.73">And then betwixt me and my married wife.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.74">Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.75">And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.76">Part us, Northumberland; I toward the
> north,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.77">Where shivering cold and sickness pines the
> clime;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.78">My wife to France: from whence, set forth in
> pomp,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.79">She came adorned hither like sweet May,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.80">Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of
> day.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="5.1.81">And must we be divided? must we part?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.1.82">Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from
> heart.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="5.1.83">Banish us both and send the king with me.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**NORTHUMBERLAND**</span>

> <span id="5.1.84">That were some love but little policy.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="5.1.85">Then whither he goes, thither let me go.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.1.86">So two, together weeping, make one woe.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.87">Weep thou for me in France, I for thee
> here;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.88">Better far off than near, be ne'er the
> near.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.89">Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with
> groans.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="5.1.90">So longest way shall have the longest
> moans.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.1.91">Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being
> short,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.92">And piece the way out with a heavy heart.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.93">Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be
> brief,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.94">Since, wedding it, there is such length in
> grief;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.95">One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly
> part;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.96">Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy
> heart.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**QUEEN**</span>

> <span id="5.1.97">Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part</span>  
> <span id="5.1.98">To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.99">So, now I have mine own again, be gone,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.100">That I might strive to kill it with a
> groan.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**KING RICHARD II**</span>

> <span id="5.1.101">We make woe wanton with this fond delay:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.102">Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
