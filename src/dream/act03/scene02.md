## SCENE II

### Another part of the wood.

> *Enter OBERON*

<span id="speech1">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="3.2.1">I wonder if Titania be awaked;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.2">Then, what it was that next came in her eye,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.3">Which she must dote on in extremity.</span>  
>
> *Enter PUCK*
>
> <span id="3.2.4">Here comes my messenger.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.5">How now, mad spirit!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.6">What night-rule now about this haunted
> grove?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="3.2.7">My mistress with a monster is in love.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.8">Near to her close and consecrated bower,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.9">While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.10">A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.11">That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.12">Were met together to rehearse a play</span>  
> <span id="3.2.13">Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.14">The shallowest thick-skin of that barren
> sort,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.15">Who Pyramus presented, in their sport</span>  
> <span id="3.2.16">Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake</span>  
> <span id="3.2.17">When I did him at this advantage take,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.18">An ass's nole I fixed on his head:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.19">Anon his Thisbe must be answered,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.20">And forth my mimic comes. When they him
> spy,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.21">As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.22">Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.23">Rising and cawing at the gun's report,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.24">Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.25">So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.26">And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one
> falls;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.27">He murder cries and help from Athens calls.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.28">Their sense thus weak, lost with their
> fears</span>  
> <span id="3.2.29">thus strong,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.30">Made senseless things begin to do them
> wrong;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.31">For briers and thorns at their apparel
> snatch;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.32">Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all</span>  
> <span id="3.2.33">things catch.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.34">I led them on in this distracted fear,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.35">And left sweet Pyramus translated there:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.36">When in that moment, so it came to pass,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.37">Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="3.2.38">This falls out better than I could devise.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.39">But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's
> eyes</span>  
> <span id="3.2.40">With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="3.2.41">I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd
> too,--</span>  
> <span id="3.2.42">And the Athenian woman by his side:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.43">That, when he waked, of force she must be
> eyed.</span>  
>
> *Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS*

<span id="speech5">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="3.2.44">Stand close: this is the same Athenian.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="3.2.45">This is the woman, but not this the man.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.46">O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.47">Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.48">Now I but chide; but I should use thee
> worse,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.49">For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to
> curse,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.50">If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.51">Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the
> deep,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.52">And kill me too.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.53">The sun was not so true unto the day</span>  
> <span id="3.2.54">As he to me: would he have stolen away</span>  
> <span id="3.2.55">From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon</span>  
> <span id="3.2.56">This whole earth may be bored and that the
> moon</span>  
> <span id="3.2.57">May through the centre creep and so
> displease</span>  
> <span id="3.2.58">Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.59">It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.60">So should a murderer look, so dead, so
> grim.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.61">So should the murder'd look, and so should
> I,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.62">Pierced through the heart with your stern
> cruelty:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.63">Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as
> clear,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.64">As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.65">What's this to my Lysander? where is he?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.66">Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.67">I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.68">Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the
> bounds</span>  
> <span id="3.2.69">Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him,
> then?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.70">Henceforth be never number'd among men!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.71">O, once tell true, tell true, even for my
> sake!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.72">Durst thou have look'd upon him being
> awake,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.73">And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave
> touch!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.74">Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.75">An adder did it; for with doubler tongue</span>  
> <span id="3.2.76">Than thine, thou serpent, never adder
> stung.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.77">You spend your passion on a misprised mood:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.78">I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.79">Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.80">I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.81">An if I could, what should I get therefore?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.82">A privilege never to see me more.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.83">And from thy hated presence part I so:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.84">See me no more, whether he be dead or no.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech17">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.85">There is no following her in this fierce
> vein:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.86">Here therefore for a while I will remain.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.87">So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow</span>  
> <span id="3.2.88">For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow
> owe:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.89">Which now in some slight measure it will
> pay,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.90">If for his tender here I make some stay.</span>  
>
> *Lies down and sleeps*

<span id="speech18">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="3.2.91">What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken
> quite</span>  
> <span id="3.2.92">And laid the love-juice on some true-love's
> sight:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.93">Of thy misprision must perforce ensue</span>  
> <span id="3.2.94">Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd
> true.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="3.2.95">Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding
> troth,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.96">A million fail, confounding oath on oath.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="3.2.97">About the wood go swifter than the wind,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.98">And Helena of Athens look thou find:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.99">All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.100">With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood
> dear:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.101">By some illusion see thou bring her here:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.102">I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="3.2.103">I go, I go; look how I go,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.104">Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech22">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="3.2.105">Flower of this purple dye,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.106">Hit with Cupid's archery,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.107">Sink in apple of his eye.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.108">When his love he doth espy,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.109">Let her shine as gloriously</span>  
> <span id="3.2.110">As the Venus of the sky.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.111">When thou wakest, if she be by,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.112">Beg of her for remedy.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter PUCK*

<span id="speech23">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="3.2.113">Captain of our fairy band,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.114">Helena is here at hand;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.115">And the youth, mistook by me,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.116">Pleading for a lover's fee.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.117">Shall we their fond pageant see?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.118">Lord, what fools these mortals be!</span>  

<span id="speech24">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="3.2.119">Stand aside: the noise they make</span>  
> <span id="3.2.120">Will cause Demetrius to awake.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="3.2.121">Then will two at once woo one;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.122">That must needs be sport alone;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.123">And those things do best please me</span>  
> <span id="3.2.124">That befal preposterously.</span>  
>
> *Enter LYSANDER and HELENA*

<span id="speech26">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="3.2.125">Why should you think that I should woo in
> scorn?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.126">Scorn and derision never come in tears:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.127">Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so
> born,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.128">In their nativity all truth appears.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.129">How can these things in me seem scorn to
> you,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.130">Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them
> true?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.131">You do advance your cunning more and more.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.132">When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy
> fray!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.133">These vows are Hermia's: will you give her
> o'er?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.134">Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing
> weigh:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.135">Your vows to her and me, put in two
> scales,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.136">Will even weigh, and both as light as
> tales.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="3.2.137">I had no judgment when to her I swore.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.138">Nor none, in my mind, now you give her
> o'er.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="3.2.139">Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.140">\[Awaking\] O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect,
> divine!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.141">To what, my love, shall I compare thine
> eyne?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.142">Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show</span>  
> <span id="3.2.143">Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting
> grow!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.144">That pure congealed white, high Taurus
> snow,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.145">Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a
> crow</span>  
> <span id="3.2.146">When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me
> kiss</span>  
> <span id="3.2.147">This princess of pure white, this seal of
> bliss!</span>  

<span id="speech32">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.148">O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent</span>  
> <span id="3.2.149">To set against me for your merriment:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.150">If you we re civil and knew courtesy,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.151">You would not do me thus much injury.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.152">Can you not hate me, as I know you do,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.153">But you must join in souls to mock me too?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.154">If you were men, as men you are in show,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.155">You would not use a gentle lady so;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.156">To vow, and swear, and superpraise my
> parts,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.157">When I am sure you hate me with your
> hearts.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.158">You both are rivals, and love Hermia;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.159">And now both rivals, to mock Helena:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.160">A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.161">To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes</span>  
> <span id="3.2.162">With your derision! none of noble sort</span>  
> <span id="3.2.163">Would so offend a virgin, and extort</span>  
> <span id="3.2.164">A poor soul's patience, all to make you
> sport.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="3.2.165">You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.166">For you love Hermia; this you know I know:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.167">And here, with all good will, with all my
> heart,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.168">In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.169">And yours of Helena to me bequeath,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.170">Whom I do love and will do till my death.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.171">Never did mockers waste more idle breath.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.172">Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.173">If e'er I loved her, all that love is
> gone.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.174">My heart to her but as guest-wise
> sojourn'd,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.175">And now to Helen is it home return'd,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.176">There to remain.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="3.2.177">Helen, it is not so.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="3.2.178">Disparage not the faith thou dost not
> know,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.179">Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.180">Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy
> dear.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter HERMIA*

<span id="speech38">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.181">Dark night, that from the eye his function
> takes,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.182">The ear more quick of apprehension makes;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.183">Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.184">It pays the hearing double recompense.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.185">Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.186">Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy
> sound</span>  
> <span id="3.2.187">But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?</span>  

<span id="speech39">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="3.2.188">Why should he stay, whom love doth press to
> go?</span>  

<span id="speech40">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.189">What love could press Lysander from my
> side?</span>  

<span id="speech41">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="3.2.190">Lysander's love, that would not let him
> bide,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.191">Fair Helena, who more engilds the night</span>  
> <span id="3.2.192">Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.193">Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee
> know,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.194">The hate I bear thee made me leave thee
> so?</span>  

<span id="speech42">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.195">You speak not as you think: it cannot be.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.196">Lo, she is one of this confederacy!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.197">Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all
> three</span>  
> <span id="3.2.198">To fashion this false sport, in spite of
> me.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.199">Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.200">Have you conspired, have you with these
> contrived</span>  
> <span id="3.2.201">To bait me with this foul derision?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.202">Is all the counsel that we two have
> shared,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.203">The sisters' vows, the hours that we have
> spent,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.204">When we have chid the hasty-footed time</span>  
> <span id="3.2.205">For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.206">All school-days' friendship, childhood
> innocence?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.207">We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.208">Have with our needles created both one
> flower,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.209">Both on one sampler, sitting on one
> cushion,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.210">Both warbling of one song, both in one
> key,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.211">As if our hands, our sides, voices and
> minds,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.212">Had been incorporate. So we grow together,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.213">Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.214">But yet an union in partition;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.215">Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.216">So, with two seeming bodies, but one
> heart;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.217">Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.218">Due but to one and crowned with one crest.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.219">And will you rent our ancient love
> asunder,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.220">To join with men in scorning your poor
> friend?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.221">It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.222">Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for
> it,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.223">Though I alone do feel the injury.</span>  

<span id="speech44">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.224">I am amazed at your passionate words.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.225">I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn
> me.</span>  

<span id="speech45">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.226">Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.227">To follow me and praise my eyes and face?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.228">And made your other love, Demetrius,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.229">Who even but now did spurn me with his
> foot,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.230">To call me goddess, nymph, divine and
> rare,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.231">Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he
> this</span>  
> <span id="3.2.232">To her he hates? and wherefore doth
> Lysander</span>  
> <span id="3.2.233">Deny your love, so rich within his soul,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.234">And tender me, forsooth, affection,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.235">But by your setting on, by your consent?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.236">What thought I be not so in grace as you,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.237">So hung upon with love, so fortunate,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.238">But miserable most, to love unloved?</span>  
> <span id="3.2.239">This you should pity rather than despise.</span>  

<span id="speech46">**HERNIA**</span>

> <span id="3.2.240">I understand not what you mean by this.</span>
