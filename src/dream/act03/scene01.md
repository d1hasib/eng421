## SCENE I

### The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.

> *Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING*

<span id="speech1">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="3.1.1">Are we all met?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.2">Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient
> place</span>  
> <span id="3.1.3">for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be
> our</span>  
> <span id="3.1.4">stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and
> we</span>  
> <span id="3.1.5">will do it in action as we will do it before the
> duke.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="3.1.6">Peter Quince,--</span>  

<span id="speech4">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.7">What sayest thou, bully Bottom?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="3.1.8">There are things in this comedy of Pyramus
> and</span>  
> <span id="3.1.9">Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus
> must</span>  
> <span id="3.1.10">draw a sword to kill himself; which the
> ladies</span>  
> <span id="3.1.11">cannot abide. How answer you that?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**SNOUT**</span>

> <span id="3.1.12">By'r lakin, a parlous fear.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**STARVELING**</span>

> <span id="3.1.13">I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is
> done.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="3.1.14">Not a whit: I have a device to make all
> well.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.15">Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem
> to</span>  
> <span id="3.1.16">say, we will do no harm with our swords, and
> that</span>  
> <span id="3.1.17">Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the
> more</span>  
> <span id="3.1.18">better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am
> not</span>  
> <span id="3.1.19">Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put
> them</span>  
> <span id="3.1.20">out of fear.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.21">Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall
> be</span>  
> <span id="3.1.22">written in eight and six.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="3.1.23">No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and
> eight.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**SNOUT**</span>

> <span id="3.1.24">Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**STARVELING**</span>

> <span id="3.1.25">I fear it, I promise you.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="3.1.26">Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves:
> to</span>  
> <span id="3.1.27">bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is
> a</span>  
> <span id="3.1.28">most dreadful thing; for there is not a more
> fearful</span>  
> <span id="3.1.29">wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought
> to</span>  
> <span id="3.1.30">look to 't.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**SNOUT**</span>

> <span id="3.1.31">Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a
> lion.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="3.1.32">Nay, you must name his name, and half his face
> must</span>  
> <span id="3.1.33">be seen through the lion's neck: and he
> himself</span>  
> <span id="3.1.34">must speak through, saying thus, or to the
> same</span>  
> <span id="3.1.35">defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would
> wish</span>  
> <span id="3.1.36">You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I
> would</span>  
> <span id="3.1.37">entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my
> life</span>  
> <span id="3.1.38">for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion,
> it</span>  
> <span id="3.1.39">were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am
> a</span>  
> <span id="3.1.40">man as other men are;' and there indeed let him
> name</span>  
> <span id="3.1.41">his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the
> joiner.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.42">Well it shall be so. But there is two hard
> things;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.43">that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber;
> for,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.44">you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by
> moonlight.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**SNOUT**</span>

> <span id="3.1.45">Doth the moon shine that night we play our
> play?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="3.1.46">A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac;
> find</span>  
> <span id="3.1.47">out moonshine, find out moonshine.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.48">Yes, it doth shine that night.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="3.1.49">Why, then may you leave a casement of the
> great</span>  
> <span id="3.1.50">chamber window, where we play, open, and the
> moon</span>  
> <span id="3.1.51">may shine in at the casement.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.52">Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of
> thorns</span>  
> <span id="3.1.53">and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or
> to</span>  
> <span id="3.1.54">present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there
> is</span>  
> <span id="3.1.55">another thing: we must have a wall in the
> great</span>  
> <span id="3.1.56">chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story,
> did</span>  
> <span id="3.1.57">talk through the chink of a wall.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**SNOUT**</span>

> <span id="3.1.58">You can never bring in a wall. What say you,
> Bottom?</span>  

<span id="speech23">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="3.1.59">Some man or other must present Wall: and let
> him</span>  
> <span id="3.1.60">have some plaster, or some loam, or some
> rough-cast</span>  
> <span id="3.1.61">about him, to signify wall; and let him hold
> his</span>  
> <span id="3.1.62">fingers thus, and through that cranny shall
> Pyramus</span>  
> <span id="3.1.63">and Thisby whisper.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.64">If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit
> down,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.65">every mother's son, and rehearse your
> parts.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.66">Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken
> your</span>  
> <span id="3.1.67">speech, enter into that brake: and so every
> one</span>  
> <span id="3.1.68">according to his cue.</span>  
>
> *Enter PUCK behind*

<span id="speech25">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="3.1.69">What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering
> here,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.70">So near the cradle of the fairy queen?</span>  
> <span id="3.1.71">What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.72">An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.73">Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="3.1.74">Thisby, the flowers of odious savours
> sweet,--</span>  

<span id="speech28">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.75">Odours, odours.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="3.1.76">--odours savours sweet:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.77">So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.78">But hark, a voice! stay thou but here
> awhile,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.79">And by and by I will to thee appear.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech30">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="3.1.80">A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech31">**FLUTE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.81">Must I speak now?</span>  

<span id="speech32">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.82">Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he
> goes</span>  
> <span id="3.1.83">but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come
> again.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**FLUTE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.84">Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of
> hue,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.85">Of colour like the red rose on triumphant
> brier,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.86">Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely
> Jew,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.87">As true as truest horse that yet would never

> <span id="3.1.88">I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.89">'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak
> that</span>  
> <span id="3.1.90">yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all
> your</span>  
> <span id="3.1.91">part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your
> cue</span>  
> <span id="3.1.92">is past; it is, 'never tire.'</span>  

<span id="speech35">**FLUTE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.93">O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would</span>  
> <span id="3.1.94">never tire.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head*

<span id="speech36">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="3.1.95">If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="3.1.96">O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted.
> Pray,</span>

> *Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING*

<span id="speech38">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="3.1.98">I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a
