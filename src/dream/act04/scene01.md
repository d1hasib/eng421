## SCENE I

### The same. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA lying asleep.

> *Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM; PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, MUSTARDSEED,
> and other Fairies attending; OBERON behind unseen*

<span id="speech1">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="4.1.2">Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.3">While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.4">And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth
> head,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.5">And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="4.1.6">Where's Peaseblossom?</span>  

<span id="speech3">**PEASEBLOSSOM**</span>

> <span id="4.1.7">Ready.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="4.1.8">Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur
> Cobweb?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**COBWEB**</span>

> <span id="4.1.9">Ready.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="4.1.10">Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you
> your</span>  
> <span id="4.1.11">weapons in your hand, and kill me a
> red-hipped</span>  
> <span id="4.1.12">humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and,
> good</span>  
> <span id="4.1.13">mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not
> fret</span>  
> <span id="4.1.14">yourself too much in the action, mounsieur;
> and,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.15">good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break
> not;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.16">I would be loath to have you overflown with
> a</span>  
> <span id="4.1.17">honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur
> Mustardseed?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**MUSTARDSEED**</span>

> <span id="4.1.18">Ready.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="4.1.19">Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray
> you,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.20">leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**MUSTARDSEED**</span>

> <span id="4.1.21">What's your Will?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="4.1.22">Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery
> Cobweb</span>  
> <span id="4.1.23">to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur;
> for</span>  
> <span id="4.1.24">methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and
> I</span>  
> <span id="4.1.25">am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle
> me,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.26">I must scratch.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="4.1.27">What, wilt thou hear some music,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.28">my sweet love?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="4.1.29">I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's
> have</span>  
> <span id="4.1.30">the tongs and the bones.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="4.1.31">Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to
> eat.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="4.1.32">Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your
> good</span>  
> <span id="4.1.33">dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a
> bottle</span>  
> <span id="4.1.34">of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no
> fellow.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="4.1.35">I have a venturous fairy that shall seek</span>  
> <span id="4.1.36">The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new
> nuts.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="4.1.37">I had rather have a handful or two of dried
> peas.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.38">But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me:
> I</span>  
> <span id="4.1.39">have an exposition of sleep come upon me.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="4.1.40">Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my
> arms.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.41">Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt fairies*
>
> <span id="4.1.42">So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle</span>  
> <span id="4.1.43">Gently entwist; the female ivy so</span>  
> <span id="4.1.44">Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.45">O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!</span>  
>
> *They sleep*
>
> *Enter PUCK*

<span id="speech18">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="4.1.46">\[Advancing\] Welcome, good Robin.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.47">See'st thou this sweet sight?</span>  
> <span id="4.1.48">Her dotage now I do begin to pity:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.49">For, meeting her of late behind the wood,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.50">Seeking sweet favours from this hateful
> fool,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.51">I did upbraid her and fall out with her;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.52">For she his hairy temples then had rounded</span>  
> <span id="4.1.53">With a coronet of fresh and fragrant
> flowers;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.54">And that same dew, which sometime on the
> buds</span>  
> <span id="4.1.55">Was wont to swell like round and orient
> pearls,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.56">Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes</span>  
> <span id="4.1.57">Like tears that did their own disgrace
> bewail.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.58">When I had at my pleasure taunted her</span>  
> <span id="4.1.59">And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.60">I then did ask of her her changeling child;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.61">Which straight she gave me, and her fairy
> sent</span>  
> <span id="4.1.62">To bear him to my bower in fairy land.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.63">And now I have the boy, I will undo</span>  
> <span id="4.1.64">This hateful imperfection of her eyes:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.65">And, gentle Puck, take this transformed
> scalp</span>  
> <span id="4.1.66">From off the head of this Athenian swain;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.67">That, he awaking when the other do,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.68">May all to Athens back again repair</span>  
> <span id="4.1.69">And think no more of this night's accidents</span>  
> <span id="4.1.70">But as the fierce vexation of a dream.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.71">But first I will release the fairy queen.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.72">Be as thou wast wont to be;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.73">See as thou wast wont to see:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.74">Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower</span>  
> <span id="4.1.75">Hath such force and blessed power.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.76">Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="4.1.77">My Oberon! what visions have I seen!</span>  
> <span id="4.1.78">Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="4.1.79">There lies your love.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="4.1.80">How came these things to pass?</span>  
> <span id="4.1.81">O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!</span>  

<span id="speech22">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="4.1.82">Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.83">Titania, music call; and strike more dead</span>  
> <span id="4.1.84">Than common sleep of all these five the
> sense.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="4.1.85">Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!</span>  
>
> *Music, still*

<span id="speech24">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="4.1.86">Now, when thou wakest, with thine</span>  
> <span id="4.1.87">own fool's eyes peep.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="4.1.88">Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with
> me,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.89">And rock the ground whereon these sleepers
> be.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.90">Now thou and I are new in amity,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.91">And will to-morrow midnight solemnly</span>  
> <span id="4.1.92">Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.93">And bless it to all fair prosperity:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.94">There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be</span>  
> <span id="4.1.95">Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="4.1.96">Fairy king, attend, and mark:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.97">I do hear the morning lark.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="4.1.98">Then, my queen, in silence sad,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.99">Trip we after the night's shade:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.100">We the globe can compass soon,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.101">Swifter than the wandering moon.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="4.1.102">Come, my lord, and in our flight</span>  
> <span id="4.1.103">Tell me how it came this night</span>  
> <span id="4.1.104">That I sleeping here was found</span>  
> <span id="4.1.105">With these mortals on the ground.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
>
> *Horns winded within*
>
> *Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train*

<span id="speech29">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.106">Go, one of you, find out the forester;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.107">For now our observation is perform'd;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.108">And since we have the vaward of the day,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.109">My love shall hear the music of my hounds.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.110">Uncouple in the western valley; let them
> go:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.111">Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.</span>  
>
> *Exit an Attendant*
>
> <span id="4.1.112">We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's
> top,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.113">And mark the musical confusion</span>  
> <span id="4.1.114">Of hounds and echo in conjunction.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**HIPPOLYTA**</span>

> <span id="4.1.115">I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.116">When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the
> bear</span>  
> <span id="4.1.117">With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear</span>  
> <span id="4.1.118">Such gallant chiding: for, besides the
> groves,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.119">The skies, the fountains, every region
> near</span>  
> <span id="4.1.120">Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard</span>  
> <span id="4.1.121">So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.122">My hounds are bred out of the Spartan
> kind,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.123">So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are
> hung</span>  
> <span id="4.1.124">With ears that sweep away the morning dew;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.125">Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian
> bulls;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.126">Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like
> bells,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.127">Each under each. A cry more tuneable</span>  
> <span id="4.1.128">Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with
> horn,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.129">In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.130">Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are
> these?</span>  

<span id="speech32">**EGEUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.131">My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.132">And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.133">This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.134">I wonder of their being here together.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.135">No doubt they rose up early to observe</span>  
> <span id="4.1.136">The rite of May, and hearing our intent,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.137">Came here in grace our solemnity.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.138">But speak, Egeus; is not this the day</span>  
> <span id="4.1.139">That Hermia should give answer of her
> choice?</span>  

<span id="speech34">**EGEUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.140">It is, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.141">Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their
> horns.</span>  
>
> *Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA wake
> and start up*
>
> <span id="4.1.142">Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is
> past:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.143">Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?</span>  

<span id="speech36">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="4.1.144">Pardon, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.145">I pray you all, stand up.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.146">I know you two are rival enemies:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.147">How comes this gentle concord in the
> world,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.148">That hatred is so far from jealousy,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.149">To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?</span>  

<span id="speech38">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="4.1.150">My lord, I shall reply amazedly,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.151">Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I
> swear,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.152">I cannot truly say how I came here;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.153">But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.154">And now do I bethink me, so it is,--</span>  
> <span id="4.1.155">I came with Hermia hither: our intent</span>  
> <span id="4.1.156">Was to be gone from Athens, where we
> might,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.157">Without the peril of the Athenian law.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**EGEUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.158">Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.159">I beg the law, the law, upon his head.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.160">They would have stolen away; they would,
> Demetrius,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.161">Thereby to have defeated you and me,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.162">You of your wife and me of my consent,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.163">Of my consent that she should be your
> wife.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.164">My lord, fair Helen told me of their
> stealth,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.165">Of this their purpose hither to this wood;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.166">And I in fury hither follow'd them,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.167">Fair Helena in fancy following me.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.168">But, my good lord, I wot not by what
> power,--</span>  
> <span id="4.1.169">But by some power it is,--my love to
> Hermia,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.170">Melted as the snow, seems to me now</span>  
> <span id="4.1.171">As the remembrance of an idle gaud</span>  
> <span id="4.1.172">Which in my childhood I did dote upon;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.173">And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.174">The object and the pleasure of mine eye,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.175">Is only Helena. To her, my lord,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.176">Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.177">But, like in sickness, did I loathe this
> food;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.178">But, as in health, come to my natural
> taste,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.179">Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.180">And will for evermore be true to it.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.181">Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.182">Of this discourse we more will hear anon.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.183">Egeus, I will overbear your will;</span>  
> <span id="4.1.184">For in the temple by and by with us</span>  
> <span id="4.1.185">These couples shall eternally be knit:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.186">And, for the morning now is something

> <span id="4.1.187">Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.</span>  
> <span id="4.1.188">Away with us to Athens; three and three,</span>

> *Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train*

<span id="speech42">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="4.1.191">These things seem small and

<span id="speech43">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="4.1.192">Methinks I see these things with parted

<span id="speech44">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="4.1.194">So methinks:</span>

<span id="speech45">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

<span id="speech48">**LYSANDER**</span>
