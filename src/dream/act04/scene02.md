<span id="speech1">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="4.2.1">Have you sent to Bottom's house ? is he come home
> yet?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**STARVELING**</span>

> <span id="4.2.2">He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is</span>  
> <span id="4.2.3">transported.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**FLUTE**</span>

> <span id="4.2.4">If he come not, then the play is marred: it
> goes</span>  
> <span id="4.2.5">not forward, doth it?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="4.2.6">It is not possible: you have not a man in
> all</span>  
> <span id="4.2.7">Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**FLUTE**</span>

> <span id="4.2.8">No, he hath simply the best wit of any
> handicraft</span>  
> <span id="4.2.9">man in Athens.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="4.2.10">Yea and the best person too; and he is a
> very</span>  
> <span id="4.2.11">paramour for a sweet voice.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**FLUTE**</span>

> <span id="4.2.12">You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless
> us,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.13">a thing of naught.</span>  
>
> *Enter SNUG*

<span id="speech8">**SNUG**</span>

> <span id="4.2.14">Masters, the duke is coming from the temple,
> and</span>  
> <span id="4.2.15">there is two or three lords and ladies more
> married:</span>  
> <span id="4.2.16">if our sport had gone forward, we had all been
> made</span>  
> <span id="4.2.17">men.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**FLUTE**</span>

> <span id="4.2.18">O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence
> a</span>  
> <span id="4.2.19">day during his life; he could not have
> 'scaped</span>  
> <span id="4.2.20">sixpence a day: an the duke had not given
> him</span>  
> <span id="4.2.21">sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be
> hanged;</span>  
> <span id="4.2.22">he would have deserved it: sixpence a day
> in</span>  
> <span id="4.2.23">Pyramus, or nothing.</span>  
>
> *Enter BOTTOM*

<span id="speech10">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="4.2.24">Where are these lads? where are these
> hearts?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="4.2.25">Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy
> hour!</span>  

<span id="speech12">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="4.2.26">Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me
> not</span>  
> <span id="4.2.27">what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian.
> I</span>  
> <span id="4.2.28">will tell you every thing, right as it fell
> out.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="4.2.29">Let us hear, sweet Bottom.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="4.2.30">Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is,
> that</span>  
> <span id="4.2.31">the duke hath dined. Get your apparel
> together,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.32">good strings to your beards, new ribbons to
> your</span>  
> <span id="4.2.33">pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man
> look</span>  
> <span id="4.2.34">o'er his part; for the short and the long is,
> our</span>  
> <span id="4.2.35">play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby
> have</span>  
> <span id="4.2.36">clean linen; and let not him that plays the
> lion</span>  
> <span id="4.2.37">pair his nails, for they shall hang out for
> the</span>  
> <span id="4.2.38">lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no
> onions</span>  
> <span id="4.2.39">nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and
> I</span>  
> <span id="4.2.40">do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a
> sweet</span>  
> <span id="4.2.41">comedy. No more words: away! go, away!</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
