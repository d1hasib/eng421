## SCENE I

### Athens. The palace of THESEUS.

> *Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and Attendants*

<span id="speech1">**HIPPOLYTA**</span>

> <span id="5.1.1">'Tis strange my Theseus, that these</span>  
> <span id="5.1.2">lovers speak of.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.3">More strange than true: I never may believe</span>  
> <span id="5.1.4">These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.5">Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.6">Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend</span>  
> <span id="5.1.7">More than cool reason ever comprehends.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.8">The lunatic, the lover and the poet</span>  
> <span id="5.1.9">Are of imagination all compact:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.10">One sees more devils than vast hell can
> hold,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.11">That is, the madman: the lover, all as
> frantic,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.12">Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.13">The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.14">Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to
> heaven;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.15">And as imagination bodies forth</span>  
> <span id="5.1.16">The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen</span>  
> <span id="5.1.17">Turns them to shapes and gives to airy
> nothing</span>  
> <span id="5.1.18">A local habitation and a name.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.19">Such tricks hath strong imagination,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.20">That if it would but apprehend some joy,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.21">It comprehends some bringer of that joy;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.22">Or in the night, imagining some fear,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.23">How easy is a bush supposed a bear!</span>  

<span id="speech3">**HIPPOLYTA**</span>

> <span id="5.1.24">But all the story of the night told over,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.25">And all their minds transfigured so
> together,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.26">More witnesseth than fancy's images</span>  
> <span id="5.1.27">And grows to something of great constancy;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.28">But, howsoever, strange and admirable.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.29">Here come the lovers, full of joy and
> mirth.</span>  
>
> *Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA*
>
> <span id="5.1.30">Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of
> love</span>  
> <span id="5.1.31">Accompany your hearts!</span>  

<span id="speech5">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="5.1.32">More than to us</span>  
> <span id="5.1.33">Wait in your royal walks, your board, your
> bed!</span>  

<span id="speech6">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.34">Come now; what masques, what dances shall we
> have,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.35">To wear away this long age of three hours</span>  
> <span id="5.1.36">Between our after-supper and bed-time?</span>  
> <span id="5.1.37">Where is our usual manager of mirth?</span>  
> <span id="5.1.38">What revels are in hand? Is there no play,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.39">To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?</span>  
> <span id="5.1.40">Call Philostrate.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**PHILOSTRATE**</span>

> <span id="5.1.41">Here, mighty Theseus.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.42">Say, what abridgement have you for this
> evening?</span>  
> <span id="5.1.43">What masque? what music? How shall we
> beguile</span>  
> <span id="5.1.44">The lazy time, if not with some delight?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**PHILOSTRATE**</span>

> <span id="5.1.45">There is a brief how many sports are ripe:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.46">Make choice of which your highness will see
> first.</span>  
>
> *Giving a paper*

<span id="speech10">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.47">\[Reads\] 'The battle with the Centaurs, to be

> <span id="5.1.62">That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.63">How shall we find the concord of this

<span id="speech11">**PHILOSTRATE**</span>

> <span id="5.1.64">A play there is, my lord, some ten words
> long,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.65">Which is as brief as I have known a play;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.66">But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.67">Which makes it tedious; for in all the play</span>  
> <span id="5.1.68">There is not one word apt, one player

<span id="speech12">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.74">What are they that do play it?</span>  

<span id="speech13">**PHILOSTRATE**</span>

<span id="speech14">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.79">And we will hear it.</span>

> <span id="5.1.80">No, my noble lord;</span>

<span id="speech17">**HIPPOLYTA**</span>

> <span id="5.1.90">I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged</span>

<span id="speech19">**HIPPOLYTA**</span>

<span id="speech21">**PHILOSTRATE**</span>

<span id="speech22">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.112">Let him approach.</span>

> *Flourish of trumpets*

> *Enter QUINCE for the Prologue*

<span id="speech23">**Prologue**</span>

> <span id="5.1.113">If we offend, it is with our good will.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.114">That you should think, we come not to

> <span id="5.1.115">But with good will. To show our simple

> <span id="5.1.116">That is the true beginning of our end.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.117">Consider then we come but in despite.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.118">We do not come as minding to contest you,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.119">Our true intent is. All for your delight</span>

> <span id="5.1.121">The actors are at hand and by their show</span>  
> <span id="5.1.122">You shall know all that you are like to
> know.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.123">This fellow doth not stand upon points.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="5.1.124">He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he
> knows</span>  
> <span id="5.1.125">not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is
> not</span>  
> <span id="5.1.126">enough to speak, but to speak true.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**HIPPOLYTA**</span>

> <span id="5.1.127">Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a
> child</span>  
> <span id="5.1.128">on a recorder; a sound, but not in
> government.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.129">His speech, was like a tangled chain;
> nothing</span>  
> <span id="5.1.130">impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?</span>  
>
> *Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion*

<span id="speech28">**Prologue**</span>

> <span id="5.1.131">Gentles, perchance you wonder at this
> show;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.132">But wonder on, till truth make all things
> plain.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.133">This man is Pyramus, if you would know;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.134">This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.135">This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth
> present</span>  
> <span id="5.1.136">Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers

> <span id="5.1.137">And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are
> content</span>  
> <span id="5.1.138">To whisper. At the which let no man
> wonder.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.139">This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of
> thorn,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.140">Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will
> know,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.141">By moonshine did these lovers think no
> scorn</span>  
> <span id="5.1.142">To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to
> woo.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.143">This grisly beast, which Lion hight by
> name,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.144">The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.145">Did scare away, or rather did affright;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.146">And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.147">Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did
> stain.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.148">Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.149">And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle
> slain:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.150">Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful
> blade,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.151">He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody
> breast;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.152">And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.153">His dagger drew, and died. For all the
> rest,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.154">Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers
> twain</span>  
> <span id="5.1.155">At large discourse, while here they do
> remain.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine*

<span id="speech29">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.156">I wonder if the lion be to speak.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.157">No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses
> do.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**Wall**</span>

> <span id="5.1.158">In this same interlude it doth befall</span>  
> <span id="5.1.159">That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.160">And such a wall, as I would have you
> think,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.161">That had in it a crannied hole or chink,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.162">Through which the lovers, Pyramus and
> Thisby,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.163">Did whisper often very secretly.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.164">This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth
> show</span>  
> <span id="5.1.165">That I am that same wall; the truth is so:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.166">And this the cranny is, right and

> <span id="5.1.167">Through which the fearful lovers are to
> whisper.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.168">Would you desire lime and hair to speak
> better?</span>  

<span id="speech33">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.169">It is the wittiest partition that ever I

> <span id="5.1.170">discourse, my lord.</span>  
>
> *Enter Pyramus*

<span id="speech34">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.171">Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!</span>  

<span id="speech35">**Pyramus**</span>

> <span id="5.1.172">O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so

> <span id="5.1.173">O night, which ever art when day is not!</span>  
> <span id="5.1.174">O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,</span>

> <span id="5.1.182">O wicked wall, through whom I see no

> <span id="5.1.183">Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving

<span id="speech36">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="5.1.184">The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse

<span id="speech37">**Pyramus**</span>

> <span id="5.1.185">No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving

> <span id="5.1.187">spy her through the wall. You shall see, it

> <span id="5.1.188">fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.</span>

> *Enter Thisbe*

<span id="speech38">**Thisbe**</span>

> <span id="5.1.189">O wall, full often hast thou heard my

<span id="speech39">**Pyramus**</span>

> <span id="5.1.193">I see a voice: now will I to the chink,</span>

<span id="speech40">**Thisbe**</span>

<span id="speech43">**Pyramus**</span>

<span id="speech44">**Thisbe**</span>

<span id="speech45">**Pyramus**</span>

> <span id="5.1.201">O kiss me through the hole of this vile

<span id="speech46">**Thisbe**</span>

<span id="speech47">**Pyramus**</span>
