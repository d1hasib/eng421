## SCENE II

### Athens. QUINCE'S house.

> *Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING*

<span id="speech1">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.1">Is all our company here?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.2">You were best to call them generally, man by
> man,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.3">according to the scrip.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.4">Here is the scroll of every man's name, which
> is</span>  
> <span id="1.2.5">thought fit, through all Athens, to play in
> our</span>  
> <span id="1.2.6">interlude before the duke and the duchess, on
> his</span>  
> <span id="1.2.7">wedding-day at night.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.8">First, good Peter Quince, say what the play
> treats</span>  
> <span id="1.2.9">on, then read the names of the actors, and so
> grow</span>  
> <span id="1.2.10">to a point.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.11">Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy,
> and</span>  
> <span id="1.2.12">most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.13">A very good piece of work, I assure you, and
> a</span>  
> <span id="1.2.14">merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth
> your</span>  
> <span id="1.2.15">actors by the scroll. Masters, spread
> yourselves.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.16">Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the
> weaver.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.17">Ready. Name what part I am for, and
> proceed.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.18">You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.19">What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.20">A lover, that kills himself most gallant for
> love.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.21">That will ask some tears in the true performing
> of</span>  
> <span id="1.2.22">it: if I do it, let the audience look to
> their</span>  
> <span id="1.2.23">eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in
> some</span>  
> <span id="1.2.24">measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for
> a</span>  
> <span id="1.2.25">tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part
> to</span>  
> <span id="1.2.26">tear a cat in, to make all split.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.27">The raging rocks</span>  
> <span id="1.2.28">And shivering shocks</span>  
> <span id="1.2.29">Shall break the locks</span>  
> <span id="1.2.30">Of prison gates;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.31">And Phibbus' car</span>  
> <span id="1.2.32">Shall shine from far</span>  
> <span id="1.2.33">And make and mar</span>  
> <span id="1.2.34">The foolish Fates.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.35">This was lofty! Now name the rest of the
> players.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.36">This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover
> is</span>  
> <span id="1.2.37">more condoling.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.38">Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**FLUTE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.39">Here, Peter Quince.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.40">Flute, you must take Thisby on you.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**FLUTE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.41">What is Thisby? a wandering knight?</span>  

<span id="speech17">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.42">It is the lady that Pyramus must love.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**FLUTE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.43">Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard
> coming.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.44">That's all one: you shall play it in a mask,
> and</span>  
> <span id="1.2.45">you may speak as small as you will.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.46">An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too,
> I'll</span>  
> <span id="1.2.47">speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.48">Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby
> dear,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.49">and lady dear!'</span>  

<span id="speech21">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.50">No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you
> Thisby.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.51">Well, proceed.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.52">Robin Starveling, the tailor.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**STARVELING**</span>

> <span id="1.2.53">Here, Peter Quince.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.54">Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's
> mother.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.55">Tom Snout, the tinker.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**SNOUT**</span>

> <span id="1.2.56">Here, Peter Quince.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.57">You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's
> father:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.58">Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and,
> I</span>  
> <span id="1.2.59">hope, here is a play fitted.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**SNUG**</span>

> <span id="1.2.60">Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if
> it</span>  
> <span id="1.2.61">be, give it me, for I am slow of study.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.62">You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but
> roaring.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.63">Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I
> will</span>  
> <span id="1.2.64">do any man's heart good to hear me; I will
> roar,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.65">that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar
> again,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.66">let him roar again.'</span>  

<span id="speech31">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.67">An you should do it too terribly, you would
> fright</span>  
> <span id="1.2.68">the duchess and the ladies, that they would
> shriek;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.69">and that were enough to hang us all.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**ALL**</span>

> <span id="1.2.70">That would hang us, every mother's son.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.71">I grant you, friends, if that you should fright
> the</span>  
> <span id="1.2.72">ladies out of their wits, they would have no
> more</span>  
> <span id="1.2.73">discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate
> my</span>  
> <span id="1.2.74">voice so that I will roar you as gently as
> any</span>  
> <span id="1.2.75">sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any</span>  
> <span id="1.2.76">nightingale.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.77">You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is
> a</span>  
> <span id="1.2.78">sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in
> a</span>  
> <span id="1.2.79">summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like
> man:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.80">therefore you must needs play Pyramus.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.81">Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I
> best</span>  
> <span id="1.2.82">to play it in?</span>  

<span id="speech36">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.83">Why, what you will.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.84">I will discharge it in either your
> straw-colour</span>  
> <span id="1.2.85">beard, your orange-tawny beard, your
> purple-in-grain</span>  
> <span id="1.2.86">beard, or your French-crown-colour beard,
> your</span>  
> <span id="1.2.87">perfect yellow.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.88">Some of your French crowns have no hair at all,
> and</span>  
> <span id="1.2.89">then you will play bare-faced. But, masters,
> here</span>  
> <span id="1.2.90">are your parts: and I am to entreat you,
> request</span>  
> <span id="1.2.91">you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow
> night;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.92">and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without
> the</span>  
> <span id="1.2.93">town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for
> if</span>  
> <span id="1.2.94">we meet in the city, we shall be dogged
> with</span>  
> <span id="1.2.95">company, and our devices known. In the meantime
> I</span>  
> <span id="1.2.96">will draw a bill of properties, such as our
> play</span>  
> <span id="1.2.97">wants. I pray you, fail me not.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.98">We will meet; and there we may rehearse
> most</span>  
> <span id="1.2.99">obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect:
> adieu.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**QUINCE**</span>

> <span id="1.2.100">At the duke's oak we meet.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**BOTTOM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.101">Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
