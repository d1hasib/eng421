## SCENE I

### Athens. The palace of THESEUS.

> *Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants*

<span id="speech1">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.1">Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</span>  
> <span id="1.1.2">Draws on apace; four happy days bring in</span>  
> <span id="1.1.3">Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow</span>  
> <span id="1.1.4">This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.5">Like to a step-dame or a dowager</span>  
> <span id="1.1.6">Long withering out a young man revenue.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**HIPPOLYTA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.7">Four days will quickly steep themselves in
> night;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.8">Four nights will quickly dream away the
> time;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.9">And then the moon, like to a silver bow</span>  
> <span id="1.1.10">New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night</span>  
> <span id="1.1.11">Of our solemnities.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.12">Go, Philostrate,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.13">Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.14">Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.15">Turn melancholy forth to funerals;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.16">The pale companion is not for our pomp.</span>  
>
> *Exit PHILOSTRATE*
>
> <span id="1.1.17">Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.18">And won thy love, doing thee injuries;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.19">But I will wed thee in another key,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.20">With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.</span>  
>
> *Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS*

<span id="speech4">**EGEUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.21">Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!</span>  

<span id="speech5">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.22">Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with
> thee?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**EGEUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.23">Full of vexation come I, with complaint</span>  
> <span id="1.1.24">Against my child, my daughter Hermia.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.25">Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.26">This man hath my consent to marry her.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.27">Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious
> duke,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.28">This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my
> child;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.29">Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her
> rhymes,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.30">And interchanged love-tokens with my child:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.31">Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.32">With feigning voice verses of feigning
> love,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.33">And stolen the impression of her fantasy</span>  
> <span id="1.1.34">With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds,
> conceits,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.35">Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats,
> messengers</span>  
> <span id="1.1.36">Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.37">With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's
> heart,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.38">Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.39">To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious
> duke,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.40">Be it so she; will not here before your
> grace</span>  
> <span id="1.1.41">Consent to marry with Demetrius,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.42">I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.43">As she is mine, I may dispose of her:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.44">Which shall be either to this gentleman</span>  
> <span id="1.1.45">Or to her death, according to our law</span>  
> <span id="1.1.46">Immediately provided in that case.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.47">What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.48">To you your father should be as a god;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.49">One that composed your beauties, yea, and
> one</span>  
> <span id="1.1.50">To whom you are but as a form in wax</span>  
> <span id="1.1.51">By him imprinted and within his power</span>  
> <span id="1.1.52">To leave the figure or disfigure it.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.53">Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.54">So is Lysander.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.55">In himself he is;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.56">But in this kind, wanting your father's
> voice,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.57">The other must be held the worthier.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.58">I would my father look'd but with my eyes.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.59">Rather your eyes must with his judgment
> look.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.60">I do entreat your grace to pardon me.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.61">I know not by what power I am made bold,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.62">Nor how it may concern my modesty,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.63">In such a presence here to plead my
> thoughts;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.64">But I beseech your grace that I may know</span>  
> <span id="1.1.65">The worst that may befall me in this case,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.66">If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.67">Either to die the death or to abjure</span>  
> <span id="1.1.68">For ever the society of men.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.69">Therefore, fair Hermia, question your
> desires;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.70">Know of your youth, examine well your
> blood,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.71">Whether, if you yield not to your father's
> choice,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.72">You can endure the livery of a nun,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.73">For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.74">To live a barren sister all your life,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.75">Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless
> moon.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.76">Thrice-blessed they that master so their
> blood,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.77">To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.78">But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.79">Than that which withering on the virgin
> thorn</span>  
> <span id="1.1.80">Grows, lives and dies in single
> blessedness.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.81">So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.82">Ere I will my virgin patent up</span>  
> <span id="1.1.83">Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke</span>  
> <span id="1.1.84">My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.85">Take time to pause; and, by the next new
> moon--</span>  
> <span id="1.1.86">The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.87">For everlasting bond of fellowship--</span>  
> <span id="1.1.88">Upon that day either prepare to die</span>  
> <span id="1.1.89">For disobedience to your father's will,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.90">Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.91">Or on Diana's altar to protest</span>  
> <span id="1.1.92">For aye austerity and single life.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.93">Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield</span>  
> <span id="1.1.94">Thy crazed title to my certain right.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="1.1.95">You have her father's love, Demetrius;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.96">Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**EGEUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.97">Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.98">And what is mine my love shall render him.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.99">And she is mine, and all my right of her</span>  
> <span id="1.1.100">I do estate unto Demetrius.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="1.1.101">I am, my lord, as well derived as he,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.102">As well possess'd; my love is more than
> his;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.103">My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.104">If not with vantage, as Demetrius';</span>  
> <span id="1.1.105">And, which is more than all these boasts can
> be,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.106">I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.107">Why should not I then prosecute my right?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.108">Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.109">Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.110">And won her soul; and she, sweet lady,
> dotes,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.111">Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.112">Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**THESEUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.113">I must confess that I have heard so much,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.114">And with Demetrius thought to have spoke
> thereof;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.115">But, being over-full of self-affairs,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.116">My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.117">And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.118">I have some private schooling for you
> both.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.119">For you, fair Hermia, look you arm
> yourself</span>  
> <span id="1.1.120">To fit your fancies to your father's will;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.121">Or else the law of Athens yields you up--</span>  
> <span id="1.1.122">Which by no means we may extenuate--</span>  
> <span id="1.1.123">To death, or to a vow of single life.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.124">Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.125">Demetrius and Egeus, go along:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.126">I must employ you in some business</span>  
> <span id="1.1.127">Against our nuptial and confer with you</span>  
> <span id="1.1.128">Of something nearly that concerns
> yourselves.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**EGEUS**</span>

> <span id="1.1.129">With duty and desire we follow you.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA*

<span id="speech22">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="1.1.130">How now, my love! why is your cheek so
> pale?</span>  
> <span id="1.1.131">How chance the roses there do fade so
> fast?</span>  

<span id="speech23">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.132">Belike for want of rain, which I could
> well</span>  
> <span id="1.1.133">Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="1.1.134">Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.135">Could ever hear by tale or history,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.136">The course of true love never did run
> smooth;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.137">But, either it was different in blood,--</span>  

<span id="speech25">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.138">O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="1.1.139">Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--</span>  

<span id="speech27">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.140">O spite! too old to be engaged to young.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="1.1.141">Or else it stood upon the choice of
> friends,--</span>  

<span id="speech29">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.142">O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="1.1.143">Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.144">War, death, or sickness did lay siege to
> it,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.145">Making it momentany as a sound,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.146">Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.147">Brief as the lightning in the collied
> night,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.148">That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and
> earth,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.149">And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'</span>  
> <span id="1.1.150">The jaws of darkness do devour it up:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.151">So quick bright things come to confusion.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.152">If then true lovers have been ever
> cross'd,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.153">It stands as an edict in destiny:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.154">Then let us teach our trial patience,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.155">Because it is a customary cross,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.156">As due to love as thoughts and dreams and
> sighs,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.157">Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="1.1.158">A good persuasion: therefore, hear me,
> Hermia.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.159">I have a widow aunt, a dowager</span>  
> <span id="1.1.160">Of great revenue, and she hath no child:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.161">From Athens is her house remote seven
> leagues;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.162">And she respects me as her only son.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.163">There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.164">And to that place the sharp Athenian law</span>  
> <span id="1.1.165">Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.166">Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow
> night;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.167">And in the wood, a league without the
> town,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.168">Where I did meet thee once with Helena,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.169">To do observance to a morn of May,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.170">There will I stay for thee.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.171">My good Lysander!</span>  
> <span id="1.1.172">I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.173">By his best arrow with the golden head,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.174">By the simplicity of Venus' doves,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.175">By that which knitteth souls and prospers
> loves,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.176">And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage
> queen,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.177">When the false Troyan under sail was seen,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.178">By all the vows that ever men have broke,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.179">In number more than ever women spoke,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.180">In that same place thou hast appointed me,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.181">To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="1.1.182">Keep promise, love. Look, here comes
> Helena.</span>  
>
> *Enter HELENA*

<span id="speech35">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.183">God speed fair Helena! whither away?</span>  

<span id="speech36">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.184">Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.185">Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!</span>  
> <span id="1.1.186">Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet
> air</span>  
> <span id="1.1.187">More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.188">When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds
> appear.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.189">Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.190">Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I
> go;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.191">My ear should catch your voice, my eye your
> eye,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.192">My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet
> melody.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.193">Were the world mine, Demetrius being
> bated,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.194">The rest I'd give to be to you translated.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.195">O, teach me how you look, and with what
> art</span>  
> <span id="1.1.196">You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.197">I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.198">O that your frowns would teach my smiles such
> skill!</span>  

<span id="speech39">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.199">I give him curses, yet he gives me love.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.200">O that my prayers could such affection
> move!</span>  

<span id="speech41">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.201">The more I hate, the more he follows me.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.202">The more I love, the more he hateth me.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.203">His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</span>  

<span id="speech44">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.204">None, but your beauty: would that fault were
> mine!</span>  

<span id="speech45">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.205">Take comfort: he no more shall see my

> <span id="1.1.206">Lysander and myself will fly this place.</span>  
> <span id="1.1.207">Before the time I did Lysander see,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.208">Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.209">O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.210">That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!</span>  

<span id="speech46">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="1.1.211">Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.212">To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold</span>  
> <span id="1.1.213">Her silver visage in the watery glass,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.214">Decking with liquid pearl the bladed
> grass,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.215">A time that lovers' flights doth still

> <span id="1.1.216">Through Athens' gates have we devised to
> steal.</span>  

<span id="speech47">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.217">And in the wood, where often you and I</span>  
> <span id="1.1.218">Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.219">Emptying our bosoms of their counsel
> sweet,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.220">There my Lysander and myself shall meet;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.221">And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.222">To seek new friends and stranger

> <span id="1.1.223">Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for

> <span id="1.1.224">And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!</span>  
> <span id="1.1.225">Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our
> sight</span>  
> <span id="1.1.226">From lovers' food till morrow deep
> midnight.</span>  

<span id="speech48">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="1.1.227">I will, my Hermia.</span>  
>
> *Exit HERMIA*
>
> <span id="1.1.228">Helena, adieu:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.229">As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech49">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="1.1.230">How happy some o'er other some can be!</span>  
> <span id="1.1.231">Through Athens I am thought as fair as

> <span id="1.1.232">But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.233">He will not know what all but he do know:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.234">And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.235">So I, admiring of his qualities:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.236">Things base and vile, folding no quantity,</span>  
> <span id="1.1.237">Love can transpose to form and dignity:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.238">Love looks not with the eyes, but with the
> mind;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.239">And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted
> blind:</span>  
> <span id="1.1.240">Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement
> taste;</span>  
> <span id="1.1.241">Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:</span>
