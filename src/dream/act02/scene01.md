## SCENE I

### A wood near Athens.

> *Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK*

<span id="speech1">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="2.1.1">How now, spirit! whither wander you?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Fairy**</span>

> <span id="2.1.2">Over hill, over dale,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.3">Thorough bush, thorough brier,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.4">Over park, over pale,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.5">Thorough flood, thorough fire,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.6">I do wander everywhere,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.7">Swifter than the moon's sphere;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.8">And I serve the fairy queen,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.9">To dew her orbs upon the green.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.10">The cowslips tall her pensioners be:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.11">In their gold coats spots you see;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.12">Those be rubies, fairy favours,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.13">In those freckles live their savours:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.14">I must go seek some dewdrops here</span>  
> <span id="2.1.15">And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.16">Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be
> gone:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.17">Our queen and all our elves come here anon.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="2.1.18">The king doth keep his revels here
> to-night:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.19">Take heed the queen come not within his
> sight;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.20">For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.21">Because that she as her attendant hath</span>  
> <span id="2.1.22">A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.23">She never had so sweet a changeling;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.24">And jealous Oberon would have the child</span>  
> <span id="2.1.25">Knight of his train, to trace the forests
> wild;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.26">But she perforce withholds the loved boy,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.27">Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her
> joy:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.28">And now they never meet in grove or green,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.29">By fountain clear, or spangled starlight
> sheen,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.30">But, they do square, that all their elves for
> fear</span>  
> <span id="2.1.31">Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Fairy**</span>

> <span id="2.1.32">Either I mistake your shape and making
> quite,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.33">Or else you are that shrewd and knavish
> sprite</span>  
> <span id="2.1.34">Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he</span>  
> <span id="2.1.35">That frights the maidens of the villagery;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.36">Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the
> quern</span>  
> <span id="2.1.37">And bootless make the breathless housewife
> churn;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.38">And sometime make the drink to bear no
> barm;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.39">Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their
> harm?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.40">Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet
> Puck,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.41">You do their work, and they shall have good
> luck:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.42">Are not you he?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="2.1.43">Thou speak'st aright;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.44">I am that merry wanderer of the night.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.45">I jest to Oberon and make him smile</span>  
> <span id="2.1.46">When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.47">Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.48">And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.49">In very likeness of a roasted crab,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.50">And when she drinks, against her lips I bob</span>  
> <span id="2.1.51">And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.52">The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.53">Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.54">Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.55">And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.56">And then the whole quire hold their hips and
> laugh,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.57">And waxen in their mirth and neeze and
> swear</span>  
> <span id="2.1.58">A merrier hour was never wasted there.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.59">But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Fairy**</span>

> <span id="2.1.60">And here my mistress. Would that he were
> gone!</span>  
>
> *Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train; from the other,
> TITANIA, with hers*

<span id="speech7">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="2.1.61">Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.62">What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.63">I have forsworn his bed and company.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="2.1.64">Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.65">Then I must be thy lady: but I know</span>  
> <span id="2.1.66">When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.67">And in the shape of Corin sat all day,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.68">Playing on pipes of corn and versing love</span>  
> <span id="2.1.69">To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.70">Come from the farthest Steppe of India?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.71">But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.72">Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior
> love,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.73">To Theseus must be wedded, and you come</span>  
> <span id="2.1.74">To give their bed joy and prosperity.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="2.1.75">How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.76">Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.77">Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.78">Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering
> night</span>  
> <span id="2.1.79">From Perigenia, whom he ravished?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.80">And make him with fair AEgle break his
> faith,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.81">With Ariadne and Antiopa?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.82">These are the forgeries of jealousy:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.83">And never, since the middle summer's
> spring,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.84">Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.85">By paved fountain or by rushy brook,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.86">Or in the beached margent of the sea,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.87">To dance our ringlets to the whistling
> wind,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.88">But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our
> sport.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.89">Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.90">As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea</span>  
> <span id="2.1.91">Contagious fogs; which falling in the land</span>  
> <span id="2.1.92">Have every pelting river made so proud</span>  
> <span id="2.1.93">That they have overborne their continents:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.94">The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in
> vain,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.95">The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green
> corn</span>  
> <span id="2.1.96">Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.97">The fold stands empty in the drowned field,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.98">And crows are fatted with the murrion
> flock;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.99">The nine men's morris is fill'd up with
> mud,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.100">And the quaint mazes in the wanton green</span>  
> <span id="2.1.101">For lack of tread are undistinguishable:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.102">The human mortals want their winter here;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.103">No night is now with hymn or carol blest:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.104">Therefore the moon, the governess of
> floods,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.105">Pale in her anger, washes all the air,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.106">That rheumatic diseases do abound:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.107">And thorough this distemperature we see</span>  
> <span id="2.1.108">The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts</span>  
> <span id="2.1.109">Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.110">And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown</span>  
> <span id="2.1.111">An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds</span>  
> <span id="2.1.112">Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the
> summer,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.113">The childing autumn, angry winter, change</span>  
> <span id="2.1.114">Their wonted liveries, and the mazed
> world,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.115">By their increase, now knows not which is
> which:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.116">And this same progeny of evils comes</span>  
> <span id="2.1.117">From our debate, from our dissension;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.118">We are their parents and original.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="2.1.119">Do you amend it then; it lies in you:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.120">Why should Titania cross her Oberon?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.121">I do but beg a little changeling boy,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.122">To be my henchman.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.123">Set your heart at rest:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.124">The fairy land buys not the child of me.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.125">His mother was a votaress of my order:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.126">And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.127">Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.128">And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.129">Marking the embarked traders on the flood,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.130">When we have laugh'd to see the sails
> conceive</span>  
> <span id="2.1.131">And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.132">Which she, with pretty and with swimming
> gait</span>  
> <span id="2.1.133">Following,--her womb then rich with my young
> squire,--</span>  
> <span id="2.1.134">Would imitate, and sail upon the land,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.135">To fetch me trifles, and return again,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.136">As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.137">But she, being mortal, of that boy did
> die;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.138">And for her sake do I rear up her boy,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.139">And for her sake I will not part with him.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="2.1.140">How long within this wood intend you stay?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.141">Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.142">If you will patiently dance in our round</span>  
> <span id="2.1.143">And see our moonlight revels, go with us;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.144">If not, shun me, and I will spare your
> haunts.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="2.1.145">Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.146">Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!</span>  
> <span id="2.1.147">We shall chide downright, if I longer
> stay.</span>  
>
> *Exit TITANIA with her train*

<span id="speech19">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="2.1.148">Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this
> grove</span>  
> <span id="2.1.149">Till I torment thee for this injury.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.150">My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou
> rememberest</span>  
> <span id="2.1.151">Since once I sat upon a promontory,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.152">And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back</span>  
> <span id="2.1.153">Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath</span>  
> <span id="2.1.154">That the rude sea grew civil at her song</span>  
> <span id="2.1.155">And certain stars shot madly from their
> spheres,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.156">To hear the sea-maid's music.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="2.1.157">I remember.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="2.1.158">That very time I saw, but thou couldst
> not,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.159">Flying between the cold moon and the
> earth,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.160">Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took</span>  
> <span id="2.1.161">At a fair vestal throned by the west,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.162">And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his
> bow,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.163">As it should pierce a hundred thousand
> hearts;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.164">But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft</span>  
> <span id="2.1.165">Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery
> moon,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.166">And the imperial votaress passed on,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.167">In maiden meditation, fancy-free.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.168">Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.169">It fell upon a little western flower,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.170">Before milk-white, now purple with love's
> wound,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.171">And maidens call it love-in-idleness.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.172">Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee
> once:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.173">The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid</span>  
> <span id="2.1.174">Will make or man or woman madly dote</span>  
> <span id="2.1.175">Upon the next live creature that it sees.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.176">Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again</span>  
> <span id="2.1.177">Ere the leviathan can swim a league.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="2.1.178">I'll put a girdle round about the earth</span>  
> <span id="2.1.179">In forty minutes.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech23">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="2.1.180">Having once this juice,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.181">I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.182">And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.183">The next thing then she waking looks upon,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.184">Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.185">On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.186">She shall pursue it with the soul of love:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.187">And ere I take this charm from off her
> sight,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.188">As I can take it with another herb,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.189">I'll make her render up her page to me.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.190">But who comes here? I am invisible;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.191">And I will overhear their conference.</span>  
>
> *Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him*

<span id="speech24">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.192">I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.193">Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.194">The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.195">Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this
> wood;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.196">And here am I, and wode within this wood,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.197">Because I cannot meet my Hermia.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.198">Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no

<span id="speech25">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.199">You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.200">But yet you draw not iron, for my heart</span>  
> <span id="2.1.201">Is true as steel: leave you your power to
> draw,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.202">And I shall have no power to follow you.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.203">Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.204">Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth</span>  
> <span id="2.1.205">Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.206">And even for that do I love you the more.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.207">I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.208">The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.209">Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike

> <span id="2.1.210">Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.211">Unworthy as I am, to follow you.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.212">What worser place can I beg in your
> love,--</span>  
> <span id="2.1.213">And yet a place of high respect with me,--</span>  
> <span id="2.1.214">Than to be used as you use your dog?</span>  

<span id="speech28">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.215">Tempt not too much the hatred of my

> <span id="2.1.216">For I am sick when I do look on thee.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.217">And I am sick when I look not on you.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.218">You do impeach your modesty too much,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.219">To leave the city and commit yourself</span>  
> <span id="2.1.220">Into the hands of one that loves you not;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.221">To trust the opportunity of night</span>  
> <span id="2.1.222">And the ill counsel of a desert place</span>  
> <span id="2.1.223">With the rich worth of your virginity.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.224">Your virtue is my privilege: for that</span>  
> <span id="2.1.225">It is not night when I do see your face,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.226">Therefore I think I am not in the night;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.227">Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.228">For you in my respect are all the world:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.229">Then how can it be said I am alone,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.230">When all the world is here to look on me?</span>  

<span id="speech32">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.231">I'll run from thee and hide me in the

> <span id="2.1.232">And leave thee to the mercy of wild

<span id="speech33">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.233">The wildest hath not such a heart as you.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.234">Run when you will, the story shall be
> changed:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.235">Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.236">The dove pursues the griffin; the mild
> hind</span>  
> <span id="2.1.237">Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless

> <span id="2.1.238">When cowardice pursues and valour flies.</span>  

<span id="speech34">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.1.239">I will not stay thy questions; let me go:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.240">Or, if thou follow me, do not believe</span>

<span id="speech35">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="2.1.242">Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.243">You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!</span>  
> <span id="2.1.244">Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:</span>

> *Exit DEMETRIUS*
>
> <span id="2.1.247">I'll follow thee and make a heaven of
