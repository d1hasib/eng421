## SCENE II

### Another part of the wood.

> *Enter TITANIA, with her train*

<span id="speech1">**TITANIA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.1">Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.2">Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.3">Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.4">Some war with rere-mice for their leathern
> wings,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.5">To make my small elves coats, and some keep
> back</span>  
> <span id="2.2.6">The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and
> wonders</span>  
> <span id="2.2.7">At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.8">Then to your offices and let me rest.</span>  
>
> *The Fairies sing*
>
> <span id="2.2.9">You spotted snakes with double tongue,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.10">Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.11">Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.12">Come not near our fairy queen.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.13">Philomel, with melody</span>  
> <span id="2.2.14">Sing in our sweet lullaby;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.15">Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla,
> lullaby:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.16">Never harm,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.17">Nor spell nor charm,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.18">Come our lovely lady nigh;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.19">So, good night, with lullaby.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.20">Weaving spiders, come not here;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.21">Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.22">Beetles black, approach not near;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.23">Worm nor snail, do no offence.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.24">Philomel, with melody, & c.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Fairy**</span>

> <span id="2.2.25">Hence, away! now all is well:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.26">One aloof stand sentinel.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps*
>
> *Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids*

<span id="speech3">**OBERON**</span>

> <span id="2.2.27">What thou seest when thou dost wake,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.28">Do it for thy true-love take,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.29">Love and languish for his sake:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.30">Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.31">Pard, or boar with bristled hair,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.32">In thy eye that shall appear</span>  
> <span id="2.2.33">When thou wakest, it is thy dear:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.34">Wake when some vile thing is near.</span>  
>
> *Exit*
>
> *Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA*

<span id="speech4">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="2.2.35">Fair love, you faint with wandering in the
> wood;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.36">And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.37">We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it
> good,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.38">And tarry for the comfort of the day.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.39">Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.40">For I upon this bank will rest my head.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="2.2.41">One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.42">One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one
> troth.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.43">Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.44">Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="2.2.45">O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.46">Love takes the meaning in love's
> conference.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.47">I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit</span>  
> <span id="2.2.48">So that but one heart we can make of it;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.49">Two bosoms interchained with an oath;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.50">So then two bosoms and a single troth.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.51">Then by your side no bed-room me deny;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.52">For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.53">Lysander riddles very prettily:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.54">Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.55">If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.56">But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy</span>  
> <span id="2.2.57">Lie further off; in human modesty,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.58">Such separation as may well be said</span>  
> <span id="2.2.59">Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.60">So far be distant; and, good night, sweet
> friend:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.61">Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life
> end!</span>  

<span id="speech10">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="2.2.62">Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.63">And then end life when I end loyalty!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.64">Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his
> rest!</span>  

<span id="speech11">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.65">With half that wish the wisher's eyes be
> press'd!</span>  
>
> *They sleep*
>
> *Enter PUCK*

<span id="speech12">**PUCK**</span>

> <span id="2.2.66">Through the forest have I gone.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.67">But Athenian found I none,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.68">On whose eyes I might approve</span>  
> <span id="2.2.69">This flower's force in stirring love.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.70">Night and silence.--Who is here?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.71">Weeds of Athens he doth wear:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.72">This is he, my master said,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.73">Despised the Athenian maid;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.74">And here the maiden, sleeping sound,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.75">On the dank and dirty ground.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.76">Pretty soul! she durst not lie</span>  
> <span id="2.2.77">Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.78">Churl, upon thy eyes I throw</span>  
> <span id="2.2.79">All the power this charm doth owe.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.80">When thou wakest, let love forbid</span>  
> <span id="2.2.81">Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.82">So awake when I am gone;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.83">For I must now to Oberon.</span>  
>
> *Exit*
>
> *Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running*

<span id="speech13">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.84">Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.85">I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me
> thus.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.86">O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**DEMETRIUS**</span>

> <span id="2.2.87">Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech17">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.88">O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.89">The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.90">Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.91">For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.92">How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt
> tears:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.93">If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than
> hers.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.94">No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.95">For beasts that meet me run away for fear:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.96">Therefore no marvel though Demetrius</span>  
> <span id="2.2.97">Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.98">What wicked and dissembling glass of mine</span>  
> <span id="2.2.99">Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.100">But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.101">Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.102">Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="2.2.103">\[Awaking\] And run through fire I will for thy
> sweet sake.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.104">Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.105">That through thy bosom makes me see thy
> heart.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.106">Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word</span>  
> <span id="2.2.107">Is that vile name to perish on my sword!</span>  

<span id="speech19">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.108">Do not say so, Lysander; say not so</span>  
> <span id="2.2.109">What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what
> though?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.110">Yet Hermia still loves you: then be
> content.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="2.2.111">Content with Hermia! No; I do repent</span>  
> <span id="2.2.112">The tedious minutes I with her have spent.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.113">Not Hermia but Helena I love:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.114">Who will not change a raven for a dove?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.115">The will of man is by his reason sway'd;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.116">And reason says you are the worthier maid.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.117">Things growing are not ripe until their
> season</span>  
> <span id="2.2.118">So I, being young, till now ripe not to
> reason;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.119">And touching now the point of human skill,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.120">Reason becomes the marshal to my will</span>  
> <span id="2.2.121">And leads me to your eyes, where I
> o'erlook</span>  
> <span id="2.2.122">Love's stories written in love's richest
> book.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**HELENA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.123">Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.124">When at your hands did I deserve this
> scorn?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.125">Is't not enough, is't not enough, young
> man,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.126">That I did never, no, nor never can,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.127">Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.128">But you must flout my insufficiency?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.129">Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you
> do,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.130">In such disdainful manner me to woo.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.131">But fare you well: perforce I must confess</span>  
> <span id="2.2.132">I thought you lord of more true
> gentleness.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.133">O, that a lady, of one man refused.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.134">Should of another therefore be abused!</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech22">**LYSANDER**</span>

> <span id="2.2.135">She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou
> there:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.136">And never mayst thou come Lysander near!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.137">For as a surfeit of the sweetest things</span>  
> <span id="2.2.138">The deepest loathing to the stomach
> brings,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.139">Or as tie heresies that men do leave</span>  
> <span id="2.2.140">Are hated most of those they did deceive,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.141">So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.142">Of all be hated, but the most of me!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.143">And, all my powers, address your love and
> might</span>  
> <span id="2.2.144">To honour Helen and to be her knight!</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech23">**HERMIA**</span>

> <span id="2.2.145">\[Awaking\] Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy
> best</span>  
> <span id="2.2.146">To pluck this crawling serpent from my
> breast!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.147">Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.148">Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.149">Methought a serpent eat my heart away,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.150">And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.151">Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.152">What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no
> word?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.153">Alack, where are you speak, an if you
> hear;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.154">Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with
> fear.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.155">No? then I well perceive you all not nigh</span>  
> <span id="2.2.156">Either death or you I'll find immediately.</span>

> *Exit*
