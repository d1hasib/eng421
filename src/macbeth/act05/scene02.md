## SCENE II

### The country near Dunsinane.

> *Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, and
> Soldiers*

<span id="speech1">**MENTEITH**</span>

> <span id="5.2.1">The English power is near, led on by
> Malcolm,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.2">His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.3">Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes</span>  
> <span id="5.2.4">Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm</span>  
> <span id="5.2.5">Excite the mortified man.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**ANGUS**</span>

> <span id="5.2.6">Near Birnam wood</span>  
> <span id="5.2.7">Shall we well meet them; that way are they
> coming.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**CAITHNESS**</span>

> <span id="5.2.8">Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="5.2.9">For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file</span>  
> <span id="5.2.10">Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.11">And many unrough youths that even now</span>  
> <span id="5.2.12">Protest their first of manhood.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**MENTEITH**</span>

> <span id="5.2.13">What does the tyrant?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**CAITHNESS**</span>

> <span id="5.2.14">Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.15">Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate
> him</span>  
> <span id="5.2.16">Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.17">He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause</span>  
> <span id="5.2.18">Within the belt of rule.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**ANGUS**</span>

> <span id="5.2.19">Now does he feel</span>  
> <span id="5.2.20">His secret murders sticking on his hands;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.21">Now minutely revolts upbraid his
> faith-breach;</span>  
> <span id="5.2.22">Those he commands move only in command,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.23">Nothing in love: now does he feel his title</span>  
> <span id="5.2.24">Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe</span>  
> <span id="5.2.25">Upon a dwarfish thief.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**MENTEITH**</span>

> <span id="5.2.26">Who then shall blame</span>  
> <span id="5.2.27">His pester'd senses to recoil and start,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.28">When all that is within him does condemn</span>  
> <span id="5.2.29">Itself for being there?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**CAITHNESS**</span>

> <span id="5.2.30">Well, march we on,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.31">To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:</span>  
> <span id="5.2.32">Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.33">And with him pour we in our country's purge</span>  
> <span id="5.2.34">Each drop of us.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="5.2.35">Or so much as it needs,</span>  
> <span id="5.2.36">To dew the sovereign flower and drown the
> weeds.</span>  
> <span id="5.2.37">Make we our march towards Birnam.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt, marching*
