<span id="speech1">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.7.1">They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,</span>  
> <span id="5.7.2">But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's
> he</span>  
> <span id="5.7.3">That was not born of woman? Such a one</span>  
> <span id="5.7.4">Am I to fear, or none.</span>  
>
> *Enter YOUNG SIWARD*

<span id="speech2">**YOUNG SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.7.5">What is thy name?</span>  

<span id="speech3">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.7.6">Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**YOUNG SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.7.7">No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter
> name</span>  
> <span id="5.7.8">Than any is in hell.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.7.9">My name's Macbeth.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**YOUNG SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.7.10">The devil himself could not pronounce a
> title</span>  
> <span id="5.7.11">More hateful to mine ear.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.7.12">No, nor more fearful.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**YOUNG SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.7.13">Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword</span>  
> <span id="5.7.14">I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.</span>  
>
> *They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain*

<span id="speech9">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.7.15">Thou wast born of woman</span>  
> <span id="5.7.16">But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to
> scorn,</span>  
> <span id="5.7.17">Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.</span>  
>
> *Exit*
>
> *Alarums. Enter MACDUFF*

<span id="speech10">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="5.7.18">That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy
> face!</span>  
> <span id="5.7.19">If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of
> mine,</span>  
> <span id="5.7.20">My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me
> still.</span>  
> <span id="5.7.21">I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose
> arms</span>  
> <span id="5.7.22">Are hired to bear their staves: either thou,
> Macbeth,</span>  
> <span id="5.7.23">Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge</span>  
> <span id="5.7.24">I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst
> be;</span>  
> <span id="5.7.25">By this great clatter, one of greatest note</span>  
> <span id="5.7.26">Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!</span>  
> <span id="5.7.27">And more I beg not.</span>  
>
> *Exit. Alarums*
>
> *Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD*

<span id="speech11">**SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.7.28">This way, my lord; the castle's gently
> render'd:</span>  
> <span id="5.7.29">The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;</span>  
> <span id="5.7.30">The noble thanes do bravely in the war;</span>  
> <span id="5.7.31">The day almost itself professes yours,</span>  
> <span id="5.7.32">And little is to do.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="5.7.33">We have met with foes</span>  
> <span id="5.7.34">That strike beside us.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.7.35">Enter, sir, the castle.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt. Alarums*
