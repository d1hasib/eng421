## SCENE V

### Dunsinane. Within the castle.

> *Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum and colours*

<span id="speech1">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.5.1">Hang out our banners on the outward walls;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.2">The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's
> strength</span>  
> <span id="5.5.3">Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them
> lie</span>  
> <span id="5.5.4">Till famine and the ague eat them up:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.5">Were they not forced with those that should be
> ours,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.6">We might have met them dareful, beard to
> beard,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.7">And beat them backward home.</span>  
>
> *A cry of women within*
>
> <span id="5.5.8">What is that noise?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**SEYTON**</span>

> <span id="5.5.9">It is the cry of women, my good lord.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech3">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.5.10">I have almost forgot the taste of fears;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.11">The time has been, my senses would have
> cool'd</span>  
> <span id="5.5.12">To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair</span>  
> <span id="5.5.13">Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir</span>  
> <span id="5.5.14">As life were in't: I have supp'd full with
> horrors;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.15">Direness, familiar to my slaughterous
> thoughts</span>  
> <span id="5.5.16">Cannot once start me.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter SEYTON*
>
> <span id="5.5.17">Wherefore was that cry?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**SEYTON**</span>

> <span id="5.5.18">The queen, my lord, is dead.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.5.19">She should have died hereafter;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.20">There would have been a time for such a
> word.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.21">To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.22">Creeps in this petty pace from day to day</span>  
> <span id="5.5.23">To the last syllable of recorded time,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.24">And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</span>  
> <span id="5.5.25">The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief
> candle!</span>  
> <span id="5.5.26">Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player</span>  
> <span id="5.5.27">That struts and frets his hour upon the
> stage</span>  
> <span id="5.5.28">And then is heard no more: it is a tale</span>  
> <span id="5.5.29">Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.30">Signifying nothing.</span>  
>
> *Enter a Messenger*
>
> <span id="5.5.31">Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story
> quickly.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Messenger**</span>

> <span id="5.5.32">Gracious my lord,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.33">I should report that which I say I saw,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.34">But know not how to do it.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.5.35">Well, say, sir.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**Messenger**</span>

> <span id="5.5.36">As I did stand my watch upon the hill,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.37">I look'd toward Birnam, and anon,
> methought,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.38">The wood began to move.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.5.39">Liar and slave!</span>  

<span id="speech10">**Messenger**</span>

> <span id="5.5.40">Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:</span>  
> <span id="5.5.41">Within this three mile may you see it
> coming;</span>  
> <span id="5.5.42">I say, a moving grove.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.5.43">If thou speak'st false,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.44">Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.45">Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be
> sooth,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.46">I care not if thou dost for me as much.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.47">I pull in resolution, and begin</span>  
> <span id="5.5.48">To doubt the equivocation of the fiend</span>  
> <span id="5.5.49">That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam
> wood</span>  
> <span id="5.5.50">Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood</span>  
> <span id="5.5.51">Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!</span>  
> <span id="5.5.52">If this which he avouches does appear,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.53">There is nor flying hence nor tarrying
> here.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.54">I gin to be aweary of the sun,</span>  
> <span id="5.5.55">And wish the estate o' the world were now
> undone.</span>  
> <span id="5.5.56">Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come,
> wrack!</span>  
> <span id="5.5.57">At least we'll die with harness on our
> back.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
