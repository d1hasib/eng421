## SCENE IV

### Country near Birnam wood.

> *Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD and YOUNG SIWARD, MACDUFF,
> MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, ROSS, and Soldiers, marching*

<span id="speech1">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="5.4.1">Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand</span>  
> <span id="5.4.2">That chambers will be safe.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**MENTEITH**</span>

> <span id="5.4.3">We doubt it nothing.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.4.4">What wood is this before us?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**MENTEITH**</span>

> <span id="5.4.5">The wood of Birnam.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="5.4.6">Let every soldier hew him down a bough</span>  
> <span id="5.4.7">And bear't before him: thereby shall we
> shadow</span>  
> <span id="5.4.8">The numbers of our host and make discovery</span>  
> <span id="5.4.9">Err in report of us.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Soldiers**</span>

> <span id="5.4.10">It shall be done.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.4.11">We learn no other but the confident tyrant</span>  
> <span id="5.4.12">Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure</span>  
> <span id="5.4.13">Our setting down before 't.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="5.4.14">'Tis his main hope:</span>  
> <span id="5.4.15">For where there is advantage to be given,</span>  
> <span id="5.4.16">Both more and less have given him the
> revolt,</span>  
> <span id="5.4.17">And none serve with him but constrained
> things</span>  
> <span id="5.4.18">Whose hearts are absent too.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="5.4.19">Let our just censures</span>  
> <span id="5.4.20">Attend the true event, and put we on</span>  
> <span id="5.4.21">Industrious soldiership.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.4.22">The time approaches</span>  
> <span id="5.4.23">That will with due decision make us know</span>  
> <span id="5.4.24">What we shall say we have and what we owe.</span>  
> <span id="5.4.25">Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes
> relate,</span>  
> <span id="5.4.26">But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:</span>  
> <span id="5.4.27">Towards which advance the war.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt, marching*
