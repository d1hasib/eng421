## SCENE I

### Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.

> *Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman*

<span id="speech1">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.1">I have two nights watched with you, but can
> perceive</span>  
> <span id="5.1.2">no truth in your report. When was it she last
> walked?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Gentlewoman**</span>

> <span id="5.1.3">Since his majesty went into the field, I have
> seen</span>  
> <span id="5.1.4">her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown
> upon</span>  
> <span id="5.1.5">her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold
> it,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.6">write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and
> again</span>  
> <span id="5.1.7">return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast
> sleep.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.8">A great perturbation in nature, to receive at
> once</span>  
> <span id="5.1.9">the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of</span>  
> <span id="5.1.10">watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides
> her</span>  
> <span id="5.1.11">walking and other actual performances, what, at
> any</span>  
> <span id="5.1.12">time, have you heard her say?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Gentlewoman**</span>

> <span id="5.1.13">That, sir, which I will not report after
> her.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.14">You may to me: and 'tis most meet you
> should.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Gentlewoman**</span>

> <span id="5.1.15">Neither to you nor any one; having no witness
> to</span>  
> <span id="5.1.16">confirm my speech.</span>  
>
> *Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper*
>
> <span id="5.1.17">Lo you, here she comes! This is her very
> guise;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.18">and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand
> close.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.19">How came she by that light?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**Gentlewoman**</span>

> <span id="5.1.20">Why, it stood by her: she has light by her</span>  
> <span id="5.1.21">continually; 'tis her command.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.22">You see, her eyes are open.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**Gentlewoman**</span>

> <span id="5.1.23">Ay, but their sense is shut.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.24">What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her
> hands.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**Gentlewoman**</span>

> <span id="5.1.25">It is an accustomed action with her, to seem
> thus</span>  
> <span id="5.1.26">washing her hands: I have known her continue
> in</span>  
> <span id="5.1.27">this a quarter of an hour.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.1.28">Yet here's a spot.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.29">Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes
> from</span>  
> <span id="5.1.30">her, to satisfy my remembrance the more
> strongly.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.1.31">Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two:
> why,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.32">then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie,
> my</span>  
> <span id="5.1.33">lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need
> we</span>  
> <span id="5.1.34">fear who knows it, when none can call our power
> to</span>  
> <span id="5.1.35">account?--Yet who would have thought the old
> man</span>  
> <span id="5.1.36">to have had so much blood in him.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.37">Do you mark that?</span>  

<span id="speech17">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.1.38">The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she
> now?--</span>  
> <span id="5.1.39">What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more
> o'</span>  
> <span id="5.1.40">that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all
> with</span>  
> <span id="5.1.41">this starting.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.42">Go to, go to; you have known what you should
> not.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**Gentlewoman**</span>

> <span id="5.1.43">She has spoke what she should not, I am sure
> of</span>  
> <span id="5.1.44">that: heaven knows what she has known.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.1.45">Here's the smell of the blood still: all
> the</span>  
> <span id="5.1.46">perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this
> little</span>  
> <span id="5.1.47">hand. Oh, oh, oh!</span>  

<span id="speech21">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.48">What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely
> charged.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**Gentlewoman**</span>

> <span id="5.1.49">I would not have such a heart in my bosom for
> the</span>  
> <span id="5.1.50">dignity of the whole body.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.51">Well, well, well,--</span>  

<span id="speech24">**Gentlewoman**</span>

> <span id="5.1.52">Pray God it be, sir.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.53">This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have
> known</span>  
> <span id="5.1.54">those which have walked in their sleep who have
> died</span>  
> <span id="5.1.55">holily in their beds.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.1.56">Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not
> so</span>  
> <span id="5.1.57">pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried;
> he</span>  
> <span id="5.1.58">cannot come out on's grave.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.59">Even so?</span>  

<span id="speech28">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.1.60">To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the
> gate:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.61">come, come, come, come, give me your hand.
> What's</span>  
> <span id="5.1.62">done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to
> bed!</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech29">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.63">Will she go now to bed?</span>  

<span id="speech30">**Gentlewoman**</span>

> <span id="5.1.64">Directly.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.1.65">Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural
> deeds</span>  
> <span id="5.1.66">Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds</span>  
> <span id="5.1.67">To their deaf pillows will discharge their
> secrets:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.68">More needs she the divine than the
> physician.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.69">God, God forgive us all! Look after her;</span>  
> <span id="5.1.70">Remove from her the means of all annoyance,</span>  
> <span id="5.1.71">And still keep eyes upon her. So, good
> night:</span>  
> <span id="5.1.72">My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.</span>  
> <span id="5.1.73">I think, but dare not speak.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**Gentlewoman**</span>

> <span id="5.1.74">Good night, good doctor.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
