## SCENE VIII

### Another part of the field.

> *Enter MACBETH*

<span id="speech1">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.8.1">Why should I play the Roman fool, and die</span>  
> <span id="5.8.2">On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the
> gashes</span>  
> <span id="5.8.3">Do better upon them.</span>  
>
> *Enter MACDUFF*

<span id="speech2">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="5.8.4">Turn, hell-hound, turn!</span>  

<span id="speech3">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.8.5">Of all men else I have avoided thee:</span>  
> <span id="5.8.6">But get thee back; my soul is too much
> charged</span>  
> <span id="5.8.7">With blood of thine already.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="5.8.8">I have no words:</span>  
> <span id="5.8.9">My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier
> villain</span>  
> <span id="5.8.10">Than terms can give thee out!</span>  
>
> *They fight*

<span id="speech5">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.8.11">Thou losest labour:</span>  
> <span id="5.8.12">As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air</span>  
> <span id="5.8.13">With thy keen sword impress as make me
> bleed:</span>  
> <span id="5.8.14">Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;</span>  
> <span id="5.8.15">I bear a charmed life, which must not
> yield,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.16">To one of woman born.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="5.8.17">Despair thy charm;</span>  
> <span id="5.8.18">And let the angel whom thou still hast
> served</span>  
> <span id="5.8.19">Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's
> womb</span>  
> <span id="5.8.20">Untimely ripp'd.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.8.21">Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.22">For it hath cow'd my better part of man!</span>  
> <span id="5.8.23">And be these juggling fiends no more
> believed,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.24">That palter with us in a double sense;</span>  
> <span id="5.8.25">That keep the word of promise to our ear,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.26">And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with
> thee.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="5.8.27">Then yield thee, coward,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.28">And live to be the show and gaze o' the
> time:</span>  
> <span id="5.8.29">We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.30">Painted on a pole, and underwrit,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.31">'Here may you see the tyrant.'</span>  

<span id="speech9">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.8.32">I will not yield,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.33">To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's
> feet,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.34">And to be baited with the rabble's curse.</span>  
> <span id="5.8.35">Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.36">And thou opposed, being of no woman born,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.37">Yet I will try the last. Before my body</span>  
> <span id="5.8.38">I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.39">And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold,
> enough!'</span>  
>
> *Exeunt, fighting. Alarums*
>
> *Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD,
> ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers*

<span id="speech10">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="5.8.40">I would the friends we miss were safe
> arrived.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.8.41">Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.42">So great a day as this is cheaply bought.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="5.8.43">Macduff is missing, and your noble son.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="5.8.44">Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's
> debt:</span>  
> <span id="5.8.45">He only lived but till he was a man;</span>  
> <span id="5.8.46">The which no sooner had his prowess
> confirm'd</span>  
> <span id="5.8.47">In the unshrinking station where he fought,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.48">But like a man he died.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.8.49">Then he is dead?</span>  

<span id="speech15">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="5.8.50">Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of
> sorrow</span>  
> <span id="5.8.51">Must not be measured by his worth, for then</span>  
> <span id="5.8.52">It hath no end.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.8.53">Had he his hurts before?</span>  

<span id="speech17">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="5.8.54">Ay, on the front.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.8.55">Why then, God's soldier be he!</span>  
> <span id="5.8.56">Had I as many sons as I have hairs,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.57">I would not wish them to a fairer death:</span>  
> <span id="5.8.58">And so, his knell is knoll'd.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="5.8.59">He's worth more sorrow,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.60">And that I'll spend for him.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**SIWARD**</span>

> <span id="5.8.61">He's worth no more</span>  
> <span id="5.8.62">They say he parted well, and paid his
> score:</span>  
> <span id="5.8.63">And so, God be with him! Here comes newer
> comfort.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head*

<span id="speech21">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="5.8.64">Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where
> stands</span>  
> <span id="5.8.65">The usurper's cursed head: the time is
> free:</span>  
> <span id="5.8.66">I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's
> pearl,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.67">That speak my salutation in their minds;</span>  
> <span id="5.8.68">Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:</span>  
> <span id="5.8.69">Hail, King of Scotland!</span>  

<span id="speech22">**ALL**</span>

> <span id="5.8.70">Hail, King of Scotland!</span>  
>
> *Flourish*

<span id="speech23">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="5.8.71">We shall not spend a large expense of time</span>  
> <span id="5.8.72">Before we reckon with your several loves,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.73">And make us even with you. My thanes and
> kinsmen,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.74">Henceforth be earls, the first that ever
> Scotland</span>  
> <span id="5.8.75">In such an honour named. What's more to do,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.76">Which would be planted newly with the time,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.77">As calling home our exiled friends abroad</span>  
> <span id="5.8.78">That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;</span>  
> <span id="5.8.79">Producing forth the cruel ministers</span>  
> <span id="5.8.80">Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like
> queen,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.81">Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent
> hands</span>  
> <span id="5.8.82">Took off her life; this, and what needful
> else</span>  
> <span id="5.8.83">That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.84">We will perform in measure, time and place:</span>  
> <span id="5.8.85">So, thanks to all at once and to each one,</span>  
> <span id="5.8.86">Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.</span>  
>
> *Flourish. Exeunt*
