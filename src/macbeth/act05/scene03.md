<span id="speech1">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.3.1">Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.2">Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.3">I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy
> Malcolm?</span>  
> <span id="5.3.4">Was he not born of woman? The spirits that
> know</span>  
> <span id="5.3.5">All mortal consequences have pronounced me
> thus:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.6">'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of
> woman</span>  
> <span id="5.3.7">Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.8">false thanes,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.9">And mingle with the English epicures:</span>  
> <span id="5.3.10">The mind I sway by and the heart I bear</span>  
> <span id="5.3.11">Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with
> fear.</span>  
>
> *Enter a Servant*
>
> <span id="5.3.12">The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced
> loon!</span>  
> <span id="5.3.13">Where got'st thou that goose look?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="5.3.14">There is ten thousand--</span>  

<span id="speech3">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.3.15">Geese, villain!</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="5.3.16">Soldiers, sir.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.3.17">Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.18">Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers,
> patch?</span>  
> <span id="5.3.19">Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of
> thine</span>  
> <span id="5.3.20">Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers,
> whey-face?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="5.3.21">The English force, so please you.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.3.22">Take thy face hence.</span>  
>
> *Exit Servant*
>
> <span id="5.3.23">Seyton!--I am sick at heart,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.24">When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push</span>  
> <span id="5.3.25">Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.26">I have lived long enough: my way of life</span>  
> <span id="5.3.27">Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.28">And that which should accompany old age,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.29">As honour, love, obedience, troops of
> friends,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.30">I must not look to have; but, in their
> stead,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.31">Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour,
> breath,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.32">Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.
> Seyton!</span>  
>
> *Enter SEYTON*

<span id="speech8">**SEYTON**</span>

> <span id="5.3.33">What is your gracious pleasure?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.3.34">What news more?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**SEYTON**</span>

> <span id="5.3.35">All is confirm'd, my lord, which was
> reported.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.3.36">I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be
> hack'd.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.37">Give me my armour.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**SEYTON**</span>

> <span id="5.3.38">'Tis not needed yet.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.3.39">I'll put it on.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.40">Send out more horses; skirr the country
> round;</span>  
> <span id="5.3.41">Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine
> armour.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.42">How does your patient, doctor?</span>  

<span id="speech14">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.3.43">Not so sick, my lord,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.44">As she is troubled with thick coming
> fancies,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.45">That keep her from her rest.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.3.46">Cure her of that.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.47">Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.48">Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.49">Raze out the written troubles of the brain</span>  
> <span id="5.3.50">And with some sweet oblivious antidote</span>  
> <span id="5.3.51">Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous
> stuff</span>  
> <span id="5.3.52">Which weighs upon the heart?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.3.53">Therein the patient</span>  
> <span id="5.3.54">Must minister to himself.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.3.55">Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.56">Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.57">Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from
> me.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.58">Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor,
> cast</span>  
> <span id="5.3.59">The water of my land, find her disease,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.60">And purge it to a sound and pristine
> health,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.61">I would applaud thee to the very echo,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.62">That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I
> say.--</span>  
> <span id="5.3.63">What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.64">Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of
> them?</span>  

<span id="speech18">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.3.65">Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation</span>  
> <span id="5.3.66">Makes us hear something.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="5.3.67">Bring it after me.</span>  
> <span id="5.3.68">I will not be afraid of death and bane,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.69">Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="5.3.70">\[Aside\] Were I from Dunsinane away and
> clear,</span>  
> <span id="5.3.71">Profit again should hardly draw me here.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
