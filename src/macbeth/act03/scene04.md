## SCENE IV

### The same. Hall in the palace.

> *A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX, Lords,
> and Attendants*

<span id="speech1">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.1">You know your own degrees; sit down: at
> first</span>  
> <span id="3.4.2">And last the hearty welcome.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Lords**</span>

> <span id="3.4.3">Thanks to your majesty.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.4">Ourself will mingle with society,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.5">And play the humble host.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.6">Our hostess keeps her state, but in best
> time</span>  
> <span id="3.4.7">We will require her welcome.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.8">Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our
> friends;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.9">For my heart speaks they are welcome.</span>  
>
> *First Murderer appears at the door*

<span id="speech5">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.10">See, they encounter thee with their hearts'
> thanks.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.11">Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the
> midst:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.12">Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a
> measure</span>  
> <span id="3.4.13">The table round.</span>  
>
> *Approaching the door*
>
> <span id="3.4.14">There's blood on thy face.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**First Murderer**</span>

> <span id="3.4.15">'Tis Banquo's then.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.16">'Tis better thee without than he within.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.17">Is he dispatch'd?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**First Murderer**</span>

> <span id="3.4.18">My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for
> him.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.19">Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's
> good</span>  
> <span id="3.4.20">That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst
> it,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.21">Thou art the nonpareil.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**First Murderer**</span>

> <span id="3.4.22">Most royal sir,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.23">Fleance is 'scaped.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.24">Then comes my fit again: I had else been
> perfect,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.25">Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.26">As broad and general as the casing air:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.27">But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound
> in</span>  
> <span id="3.4.28">To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's
> safe?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**First Murderer**</span>

> <span id="3.4.29">Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.30">With twenty trenched gashes on his head;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.31">The least a death to nature.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.32">Thanks for that:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.33">There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's
> fled</span>  
> <span id="3.4.34">Hath nature that in time will venom breed,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.35">No teeth for the present. Get thee gone:
> to-morrow</span>  
> <span id="3.4.36">We'll hear, ourselves, again.</span>  
>
> *Exit Murderer*

<span id="speech14">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.37">My royal lord,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.38">You do not give the cheer: the feast is
> sold</span>  
> <span id="3.4.39">That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis
> a-making,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.40">'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at
> home;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.41">From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.42">Meeting were bare without it.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.43">Sweet remembrancer!</span>  
> <span id="3.4.44">Now, good digestion wait on appetite,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.45">And health on both!</span>  

<span id="speech16">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="3.4.46">May't please your highness sit.</span>  
>
> *The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in MACBETH's place*

<span id="speech17">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.47">Here had we now our country's honour
> roof'd,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.48">Were the graced person of our Banquo
> present;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.49">Who may I rather challenge for unkindness</span>  
> <span id="3.4.50">Than pity for mischance!</span>  

<span id="speech18">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="3.4.51">His absence, sir,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.52">Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your
> highness</span>  
> <span id="3.4.53">To grace us with your royal company.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.54">The table's full.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="3.4.55">Here is a place reserved, sir.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.56">Where?</span>  

<span id="speech22">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="3.4.57">Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your
> highness?</span>  

<span id="speech23">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.58">Which of you have done this?</span>  

<span id="speech24">**Lords**</span>

> <span id="3.4.59">What, my good lord?</span>  

<span id="speech25">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.60">Thou canst not say I did it: never shake</span>  
> <span id="3.4.61">Thy gory locks at me.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="3.4.62">Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.63">Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.64">And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep
> seat;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.65">The fit is momentary; upon a thought</span>  
> <span id="3.4.66">He will again be well: if much you note
> him,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.67">You shall offend him and extend his
> passion:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.68">Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?</span>  

<span id="speech28">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.69">Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that</span>  
> <span id="3.4.70">Which might appal the devil.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.71">O proper stuff!</span>  
> <span id="3.4.72">This is the very painting of your fear:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.73">This is the air-drawn dagger which, you
> said,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.74">Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and
> starts,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.75">Impostors to true fear, would well become</span>  
> <span id="3.4.76">A woman's story at a winter's fire,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.77">Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!</span>  
> <span id="3.4.78">Why do you make such faces? When all's
> done,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.79">You look but on a stool.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.80">Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!</span>  
> <span id="3.4.81">how say you?</span>  
> <span id="3.4.82">Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak
> too.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.83">If charnel-houses and our graves must send</span>  
> <span id="3.4.84">Those that we bury back, our monuments</span>  
> <span id="3.4.85">Shall be the maws of kites.</span>  
>
> *GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes*

<span id="speech31">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.86">What, quite unmann'd in folly?</span>  

<span id="speech32">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.87">If I stand here, I saw him.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.88">Fie, for shame!</span>  

<span id="speech34">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.89">Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden
> time,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.90">Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.91">Ay, and since too, murders have been
> perform'd</span>  
> <span id="3.4.92">Too terrible for the ear: the times have
> been,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.93">That, when the brains were out, the man would
> die,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.94">And there an end; but now they rise again,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.95">With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.96">And push us from our stools: this is more
> strange</span>  
> <span id="3.4.97">Than such a murder is.</span>  

<span id="speech35">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.98">My worthy lord,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.99">Your noble friends do lack you.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.100">I do forget.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.101">Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.102">I have a strange infirmity, which is
> nothing</span>  
> <span id="3.4.103">To those that know me. Come, love and health to
> all;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.104">Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill
> full.</span>  
> <span id="3.4.105">I drink to the general joy o' the whole
> table,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.106">And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we
> miss;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.107">Would he were here! to all, and him, we
> thirst,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.108">And all to all.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**Lords**</span>

> <span id="3.4.109">Our duties, and the pledge.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO*

<span id="speech38">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.110">Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide
> thee!</span>  
> <span id="3.4.111">Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is
> cold;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.112">Thou hast no speculation in those eyes</span>  
> <span id="3.4.113">Which thou dost glare with!</span>  

<span id="speech39">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.114">Think of this, good peers,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.115">But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.116">Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.117">What man dare, I dare:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.118">Approach thou like the rugged Russian
> bear,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.119">The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.120">Take any shape but that, and my firm
> nerves</span>  
> <span id="3.4.121">Shall never tremble: or be alive again,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.122">And dare me to the desert with thy sword;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.123">If trembling I inhabit then, protest me</span>  
> <span id="3.4.124">The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible
> shadow!</span>  
> <span id="3.4.125">Unreal mockery, hence!</span>  
>
> *GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes*
>
> <span id="3.4.126">Why, so: being gone,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.127">I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.128">You have displaced the mirth, broke the good
> meeting,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.129">With most admired disorder.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.130">Can such things be,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.131">And overcome us like a summer's cloud,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.132">Without our special wonder? You make me
> strange</span>  
> <span id="3.4.133">Even to the disposition that I owe,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.134">When now I think you can behold such
> sights,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.135">And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.136">When mine is blanched with fear.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="3.4.137">What sights, my lord?</span>  

<span id="speech44">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.138">I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and
> worse;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.139">Question enrages him. At once, good night:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.140">Stand not upon the order of your going,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.141">But go at once.</span>  

<span id="speech45">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="3.4.142">Good night; and better health</span>  
> <span id="3.4.143">Attend his majesty!</span>  

<span id="speech46">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.144">A kind good night to all!</span>  
>
> *Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH*

<span id="speech47">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.145">It will have blood; they say, blood will have
> blood:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.146">Stones have been known to move and trees to
> speak;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.147">Augurs and understood relations have</span>  
> <span id="3.4.148">By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought
> forth</span>  
> <span id="3.4.149">The secret'st man of blood. What is the
> night?</span>  

<span id="speech48">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.150">Almost at odds with morning, which is
> which.</span>  

<span id="speech49">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.151">How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his
> person</span>  
> <span id="3.4.152">At our great bidding?</span>  

<span id="speech50">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.153">Did you send to him, sir?</span>  

<span id="speech51">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.154">I hear it by the way; but I will send:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.155">There's not a one of them but in his house</span>  
> <span id="3.4.156">I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.157">And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.158">More shall they speak; for now I am bent to
> know,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.159">By the worst means, the worst. For mine own
> good,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.160">All causes shall give way: I am in blood</span>  
> <span id="3.4.161">Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no
> more,</span>  
> <span id="3.4.162">Returning were as tedious as go o'er:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.163">Strange things I have in head, that will to
> hand;</span>  
> <span id="3.4.164">Which must be acted ere they may be
> scann'd.</span>  

<span id="speech52">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.165">You lack the season of all natures, sleep.</span>  

<span id="speech53">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.4.166">Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and
> self-abuse</span>  
> <span id="3.4.167">Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:</span>  
> <span id="3.4.168">We are yet but young in deed.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
