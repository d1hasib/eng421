## SCENE II 

### The palace.

> *Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant*

<span id="speech1">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.2.1">Is Banquo gone from court?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="3.2.2">Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.2.3">Say to the king, I would attend his leisure</span>  
> <span id="3.2.4">For a few words.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Servant**</span>

> <span id="3.2.5">Madam, I will.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech5">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.2.6">Nought's had, all's spent,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.7">Where our desire is got without content:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.8">'Tis safer to be that which we destroy</span>  
> <span id="3.2.9">Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.</span>  
>
> *Enter MACBETH*
>
> <span id="3.2.10">How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.11">Of sorriest fancies your companions making,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.12">Using those thoughts which should indeed have
> died</span>  
> <span id="3.2.13">With them they think on? Things without all
> remedy</span>  
> <span id="3.2.14">Should be without regard: what's done is
> done.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.2.15">We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.16">She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor
> malice</span>  
> <span id="3.2.17">Remains in danger of her former tooth.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.18">But let the frame of things disjoint, both
> the</span>  
> <span id="3.2.19">worlds suffer,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.20">Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep</span>  
> <span id="3.2.21">In the affliction of these terrible dreams</span>  
> <span id="3.2.22">That shake us nightly: better be with the
> dead,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.23">Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to
> peace,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.24">Than on the torture of the mind to lie</span>  
> <span id="3.2.25">In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his
> grave;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.26">After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.27">Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor
> poison,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.28">Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.29">Can touch him further.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.2.30">Come on;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.31">Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged
> looks;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.32">Be bright and jovial among your guests
> to-night.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.2.33">So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.34">Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.35">Present him eminence, both with eye and
> tongue:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.36">Unsafe the while, that we</span>  
> <span id="3.2.37">Must lave our honours in these flattering
> streams,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.38">And make our faces vizards to our hearts,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.39">Disguising what they are.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.2.40">You must leave this.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.2.41">O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!</span>  
> <span id="3.2.42">Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance,
> lives.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.2.43">But in them nature's copy's not eterne.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.2.44">There's comfort yet; they are assailable;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.45">Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown</span>  
> <span id="3.2.46">His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's
> summons</span>  
> <span id="3.2.47">The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums</span>  
> <span id="3.2.48">Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be
> done</span>  
> <span id="3.2.49">A deed of dreadful note.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.2.50">What's to be done?</span>  

<span id="speech14">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.2.51">Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest
> chuck,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.52">Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling
> night,</span>  
> <span id="3.2.53">Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.54">And with thy bloody and invisible hand</span>  
> <span id="3.2.55">Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond</span>  
> <span id="3.2.56">Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the
> crow</span>  
> <span id="3.2.57">Makes wing to the rooky wood:</span>  
> <span id="3.2.58">Good things of day begin to droop and
> drowse;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.59">While night's black agents to their preys do
> rouse.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.60">Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee
> still;</span>  
> <span id="3.2.61">Things bad begun make strong themselves by
> ill.</span>  
> <span id="3.2.62">So, prithee, go with me.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
