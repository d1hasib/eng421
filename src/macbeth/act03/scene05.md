### A Heath.

> *Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE*

<span id="speech1">**First Witch**</span>

> <span id="3.5.1">Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**HECATE**</span>

> <span id="3.5.2">Have I not reason, beldams as you are,</span>  
> <span id="3.5.3">Saucy and overbold? How did you dare</span>  
> <span id="3.5.4">To trade and traffic with Macbeth</span>  
> <span id="3.5.5">In riddles and affairs of death;</span>  
> <span id="3.5.6">And I, the mistress of your charms,</span>  
> <span id="3.5.7">The close contriver of all harms,</span>  
> <span id="3.5.8">Was never call'd to bear my part,</span>  
> <span id="3.5.9">Or show the glory of our art?</span>  
> <span id="3.5.10">And, which is worse, all you have done</span>  
> <span id="3.5.11">Hath been but for a wayward son,</span>  
> <span id="3.5.12">Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,</span>  
> <span id="3.5.13">Loves for his own ends, not for you.</span>  
> <span id="3.5.14">But make amends now: get you gone,</span>  
> <span id="3.5.15">And at the pit of Acheron</span>  
> <span id="3.5.16">Meet me i' the morning: thither he</span>  
> <span id="3.5.17">Will come to know his destiny:</span>  
> <span id="3.5.18">Your vessels and your spells provide,</span>  
> <span id="3.5.19">Your charms and every thing beside.</span>  
> <span id="3.5.20">I am for the air; this night I'll spend</span>  
> <span id="3.5.21">Unto a dismal and a fatal end:</span>  
> <span id="3.5.22">Great business must be wrought ere noon:</span>  
> <span id="3.5.23">Upon the corner of the moon</span>  
> <span id="3.5.24">There hangs a vaporous drop profound;</span>  
> <span id="3.5.25">I'll catch it ere it come to ground:</span>  
> <span id="3.5.26">And that distill'd by magic sleights</span>  
> <span id="3.5.27">Shall raise such artificial sprites</span>  
> <span id="3.5.28">As by the strength of their illusion</span>  
> <span id="3.5.29">Shall draw him on to his confusion:</span>  
> <span id="3.5.30">He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear</span>  
> <span id="3.5.31">He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:</span>  
> <span id="3.5.32">And you all know, security</span>  
> <span id="3.5.33">Is mortals' chiefest enemy.</span>  
>
> *Music and a song within: 'Come away, come away,' & c*
>
> <span id="3.5.34">Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,</span>  
> <span id="3.5.35">Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech3">**First Witch**</span>

> <span id="3.5.36">Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back
> again.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
