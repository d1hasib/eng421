## SCENE I

### Forres. The palace.

> *Enter BANQUO*

<span id="speech1">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="3.1.1">Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.2">As the weird women promised, and, I fear,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.3">Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was
> said</span>  
> <span id="3.1.4">It should not stand in thy posterity,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.5">But that myself should be the root and
> father</span>  
> <span id="3.1.6">Of many kings. If there come truth from
> them--</span>  
> <span id="3.1.7">As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches
> shine--</span>  
> <span id="3.1.8">Why, by the verities on thee made good,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.9">May they not be my oracles as well,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.10">And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.</span>  
>
> *Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY MACBETH, as queen,
> LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants*

<span id="speech2">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.11">Here's our chief guest.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.12">If he had been forgotten,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.13">It had been as a gap in our great feast,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.14">And all-thing unbecoming.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.15">To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.16">And I'll request your presence.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="3.1.17">Let your highness</span>  
> <span id="3.1.18">Command upon me; to the which my duties</span>  
> <span id="3.1.19">Are with a most indissoluble tie</span>  
> <span id="3.1.20">For ever knit.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.21">Ride you this afternoon?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="3.1.22">Ay, my good lord.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.23">We should have else desired your good
> advice,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.24">Which still hath been both grave and
> prosperous,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.25">In this day's council; but we'll take
> to-morrow.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.26">Is't far you ride?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="3.1.27">As far, my lord, as will fill up the time</span>  
> <span id="3.1.28">'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the
> better,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.29">I must become a borrower of the night</span>  
> <span id="3.1.30">For a dark hour or twain.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.31">Fail not our feast.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="3.1.32">My lord, I will not.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.33">We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd</span>  
> <span id="3.1.34">In England and in Ireland, not confessing</span>  
> <span id="3.1.35">Their cruel parricide, filling their
> hearers</span>  
> <span id="3.1.36">With strange invention: but of that
> to-morrow,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.37">When therewithal we shall have cause of
> state</span>  
> <span id="3.1.38">Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse:
> adieu,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.39">Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with
> you?</span>  

<span id="speech13">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="3.1.40">Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon
> 's.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.41">I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.42">And so I do commend you to their backs.
> Farewell.</span>  
>
> *Exit BANQUO*
>
> <span id="3.1.43">Let every man be master of his time</span>  
> <span id="3.1.44">Till seven at night: to make society</span>  
> <span id="3.1.45">The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself</span>  
> <span id="3.1.46">Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with
> you!</span>  
>
> *Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant*
>
> <span id="3.1.47">Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men</span>  
> <span id="3.1.48">Our pleasure?</span>  

<span id="speech15">**ATTENDANT**</span>

> <span id="3.1.49">They are, my lord, without the palace gate.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.50">Bring them before us.</span>  
>
> *Exit Attendant*
>
> <span id="3.1.51">To be thus is nothing;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.52">But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo</span>  
> <span id="3.1.53">Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature</span>  
> <span id="3.1.54">Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he
> dares;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.55">And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.56">He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour</span>  
> <span id="3.1.57">To act in safety. There is none but he</span>  
> <span id="3.1.58">Whose being I do fear: and, under him,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.59">My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.60">Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the
> sisters</span>  
> <span id="3.1.61">When first they put the name of king upon
> me,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.62">And bade them speak to him: then
> prophet-like</span>  
> <span id="3.1.63">They hail'd him father to a line of kings:</span>  
> <span id="3.1.64">Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.65">And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.66">Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal
> hand,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.67">No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.68">For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.69">For them the gracious Duncan have I
> murder'd;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.70">Put rancours in the vessel of my peace</span>  
> <span id="3.1.71">Only for them; and mine eternal jewel</span>  
> <span id="3.1.72">Given to the common enemy of man,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.73">To make them kings, the seed of Banquo
> kings!</span>  
> <span id="3.1.74">Rather than so, come fate into the list.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.75">And champion me to the utterance! Who's
> there!</span>  
>
> *Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers*
>
> <span id="3.1.76">Now go to the door, and stay there till we
> call.</span>  
>
> *Exit Attendant*
>
> <span id="3.1.77">Was it not yesterday we spoke together?</span>  

<span id="speech17">**First Murderer**</span>

> <span id="3.1.78">It was, so please your highness.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.79">Well then, now</span>  
> <span id="3.1.80">Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know</span>  
> <span id="3.1.81">That it was he in the times past which held
> you</span>  
> <span id="3.1.82">So under fortune, which you thought had
> been</span>  
> <span id="3.1.83">Our innocent self: this I made good to you</span>  
> <span id="3.1.84">In our last conference, pass'd in probation with
> you,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.85">How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.86">the instruments,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.87">Who wrought with them, and all things else that
> might</span>  
> <span id="3.1.88">To half a soul and to a notion crazed</span>  
> <span id="3.1.89">Say 'Thus did Banquo.'</span>  

<span id="speech19">**First Murderer**</span>

> <span id="3.1.90">You made it known to us.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.91">I did so, and went further, which is now</span>  
> <span id="3.1.92">Our point of second meeting. Do you find</span>  
> <span id="3.1.93">Your patience so predominant in your nature</span>  
> <span id="3.1.94">That you can let this go? Are you so
> gospell'd</span>  
> <span id="3.1.95">To pray for this good man and for his
> issue,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.96">Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the
> grave</span>  
> <span id="3.1.97">And beggar'd yours for ever?</span>  

<span id="speech21">**First Murderer**</span>

> <span id="3.1.98">We are men, my liege.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.99">Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.100">As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels,
> curs,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.101">Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are
> clept</span>  
> <span id="3.1.102">All by the name of dogs: the valued file</span>  
> <span id="3.1.103">Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the
> subtle,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.104">The housekeeper, the hunter, every one</span>  
> <span id="3.1.105">According to the gift which bounteous
> nature</span>  
> <span id="3.1.106">Hath in him closed; whereby he does
> receive</span>  
> <span id="3.1.107">Particular addition. from the bill</span>  
> <span id="3.1.108">That writes them all alike: and so of men.</span>  
> <span id="3.1.109">Now, if you have a station in the file,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.110">Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;</span>  
> <span id="3.1.111">And I will put that business in your
> bosoms,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.112">Whose execution takes your enemy off,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.113">Grapples you to the heart and love of us,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.114">Who wear our health but sickly in his
> life,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.115">Which in his death were perfect.</span>  

<span id="speech23">**Second Murderer**</span>

> <span id="3.1.116">I am one, my liege,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.117">Whom the vile blows and buffets of the
> world</span>  
> <span id="3.1.118">Have so incensed that I am reckless what</span>  
> <span id="3.1.119">I do to spite the world.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**First Murderer**</span>

> <span id="3.1.120">And I another</span>  
> <span id="3.1.121">So weary with disasters, tugg'd with
> fortune,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.122">That I would set my lie on any chance,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.123">To mend it, or be rid on't.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.124">Both of you</span>  
> <span id="3.1.125">Know Banquo was your enemy.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**Both Murderers**</span>

> <span id="3.1.126">True, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech27">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.127">So is he mine; and in such bloody
> distance,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.128">That every minute of his being thrusts</span>  
> <span id="3.1.129">Against my near'st of life: and though I
> could</span>  
> <span id="3.1.130">With barefaced power sweep him from my
> sight</span>  
> <span id="3.1.131">And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.132">For certain friends that are both his and
> mine,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.133">Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his
> fall</span>  
> <span id="3.1.134">Who I myself struck down; and thence it
> is,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.135">That I to your assistance do make love,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.136">Masking the business from the common eye</span>  
> <span id="3.1.137">For sundry weighty reasons.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**Second Murderer**</span>

> <span id="3.1.138">We shall, my lord,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.139">Perform what you command us.</span>  

<span id="speech29">**First Murderer**</span>

> <span id="3.1.140">Though our lives--</span>  

<span id="speech30">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.141">Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at
> most</span>  
> <span id="3.1.142">I will advise you where to plant

> <span id="3.1.143">Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the
> time,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.144">The moment on't; for't must be done
> to-night,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.145">And something from the palace; always

> <span id="3.1.146">That I require a clearness: and with him--</span>  
> <span id="3.1.147">To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--</span>  
> <span id="3.1.148">Fleance his son, that keeps him company,</span>  
> <span id="3.1.149">Whose absence is no less material to me</span>  
> <span id="3.1.150">Than is his father's, must embrace the
> fate</span>  
> <span id="3.1.151">Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves

> <span id="3.1.152">I'll come to you anon.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**Both Murderers**</span>

> <span id="3.1.153">We are resolved, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="3.1.154">I'll call upon you straight: abide within.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt Murderers*
>
> <span id="3.1.155">It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's
