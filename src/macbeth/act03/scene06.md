## SCENE VI

### Forres. The palace.

> *Enter LENNOX and another Lord*

<span id="speech1">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="3.6.1">My former speeches have but hit your
> thoughts,</span>  
> <span id="3.6.2">Which can interpret further: only, I say,</span>  
> <span id="3.6.3">Things have been strangely borne. The</span>  
> <span id="3.6.4">gracious Duncan</span>  
> <span id="3.6.5">Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:</span>  
> <span id="3.6.6">And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too
> late;</span>  
> <span id="3.6.7">Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance
> kill'd,</span>  
> <span id="3.6.8">For Fleance fled: men must not walk too
> late.</span>  
> <span id="3.6.9">Who cannot want the thought how monstrous</span>  
> <span id="3.6.10">It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain</span>  
> <span id="3.6.11">To kill their gracious father? damned fact!</span>  
> <span id="3.6.12">How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not
> straight</span>  
> <span id="3.6.13">In pious rage the two delinquents tear,</span>  
> <span id="3.6.14">That were the slaves of drink and thralls of
> sleep?</span>  
> <span id="3.6.15">Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely
> too;</span>  
> <span id="3.6.16">For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive</span>  
> <span id="3.6.17">To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,</span>  
> <span id="3.6.18">He has borne all things well: and I do
> think</span>  
> <span id="3.6.19">That had he Duncan's sons under his key--</span>  
> <span id="3.6.20">As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they</span>  
> <span id="3.6.21">should find</span>  
> <span id="3.6.22">What 'twere to kill a father; so should
> Fleance.</span>  
> <span id="3.6.23">But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he
> fail'd</span>  
> <span id="3.6.24">His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear</span>  
> <span id="3.6.25">Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you
> tell</span>  
> <span id="3.6.26">Where he bestows himself?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Lord**</span>

> <span id="3.6.27">The son of Duncan,</span>  
> <span id="3.6.28">From whom this tyrant holds the due of
> birth</span>  
> <span id="3.6.29">Lives in the English court, and is received</span>  
> <span id="3.6.30">Of the most pious Edward with such grace</span>  
> <span id="3.6.31">That the malevolence of fortune nothing</span>  
> <span id="3.6.32">Takes from his high respect: thither
> Macduff</span>  
> <span id="3.6.33">Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid</span>  
> <span id="3.6.34">To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:</span>  
> <span id="3.6.35">That, by the help of these--with Him above</span>  
> <span id="3.6.36">To ratify the work--we may again</span>  
> <span id="3.6.37">Give to our tables meat, sleep to our
> nights,</span>  
> <span id="3.6.38">Free from our feasts and banquets bloody
> knives,</span>  
> <span id="3.6.39">Do faithful homage and receive free
> honours:</span>  
> <span id="3.6.40">All which we pine for now: and this report</span>  
> <span id="3.6.41">Hath so exasperate the king that he</span>  
> <span id="3.6.42">Prepares for some attempt of war.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="3.6.43">Sent he to Macduff?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Lord**</span>

> <span id="3.6.44">He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'</span>  
> <span id="3.6.45">The cloudy messenger turns me his back,</span>  
> <span id="3.6.46">And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the
> time</span>  
> <span id="3.6.47">That clogs me with this answer.'</span>  

<span id="speech5">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="3.6.48">And that well might</span>  
> <span id="3.6.49">Advise him to a caution, to hold what
> distance</span>  
> <span id="3.6.50">His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel</span>  
> <span id="3.6.51">Fly to the court of England and unfold</span>  
> <span id="3.6.52">His message ere he come, that a swift
> blessing</span>  
> <span id="3.6.53">May soon return to this our suffering
> country</span>  
> <span id="3.6.54">Under a hand accursed!</span>  

<span id="speech6">**Lord**</span>

> <span id="3.6.55">I'll send my prayers with him.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
