<span id="speech41">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="4.1.124">Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo:

> <span id="4.1.137">What, is this so?</span>  

<span id="speech42">**First Witch**</span>

> <span id="4.1.138">Ay, sir, all this is so: but why</span>  
> <span id="4.1.139">Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?</span>  
> <span id="4.1.140">Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,</span>  
> <span id="4.1.141">And show the best of our delights:</span>  
> <span id="4.1.142">I'll charm the air to give a sound,</span>

<span id="speech46">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="4.1.151">No, my lord.</span>  

<span id="speech47">**MACBETH**</span>
