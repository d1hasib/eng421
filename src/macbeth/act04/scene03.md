## SCENE III

### England. Before the King's palace.

> *Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF*

<span id="speech1">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.1">Let us seek out some desolate shade, and
> there</span>  
> <span id="4.3.2">Weep our sad bosoms empty.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.3">Let us rather</span>  
> <span id="4.3.4">Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good
> men</span>  
> <span id="4.3.5">Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new
> morn</span>  
> <span id="4.3.6">New widows howl, new orphans cry, new
> sorrows</span>  
> <span id="4.3.7">Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds</span>  
> <span id="4.3.8">As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out</span>  
> <span id="4.3.9">Like syllable of dolour.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.10">What I believe I'll wail,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.11">What know believe, and what I can redress,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.12">As I shall find the time to friend, I will.</span>  
> <span id="4.3.13">What you have spoke, it may be so
> perchance.</span>  
> <span id="4.3.14">This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our
> tongues,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.15">Was once thought honest: you have loved him
> well.</span>  
> <span id="4.3.16">He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.17">but something</span>  
> <span id="4.3.18">You may deserve of him through me, and
> wisdom</span>  
> <span id="4.3.19">To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb</span>  
> <span id="4.3.20">To appease an angry god.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.21">I am not treacherous.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.22">But Macbeth is.</span>  
> <span id="4.3.23">A good and virtuous nature may recoil</span>  
> <span id="4.3.24">In an imperial charge. But I shall crave</span>  
> <span id="4.3.25">your pardon;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.26">That which you are my thoughts cannot
> transpose:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.27">Angels are bright still, though the brightest
> fell;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.28">Though all things foul would wear the brows of
> grace,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.29">Yet grace must still look so.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.30">I have lost my hopes.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.31">Perchance even there where I did find my
> doubts.</span>  
> <span id="4.3.32">Why in that rawness left you wife and
> child,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.33">Those precious motives, those strong knots of
> love,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.34">Without leave-taking? I pray you,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.35">Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.36">But mine own safeties. You may be rightly
> just,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.37">Whatever I shall think.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.38">Bleed, bleed, poor country!</span>  
> <span id="4.3.39">Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.40">For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear
> thou</span>  
> <span id="4.3.41">thy wrongs;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.42">The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well,
> lord:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.43">I would not be the villain that thou
> think'st</span>  
> <span id="4.3.44">For the whole space that's in the tyrant's
> grasp,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.45">And the rich East to boot.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.46">Be not offended:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.47">I speak not as in absolute fear of you.</span>  
> <span id="4.3.48">I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.49">It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a
> gash</span>  
> <span id="4.3.50">Is added to her wounds: I think withal</span>  
> <span id="4.3.51">There would be hands uplifted in my right;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.52">And here from gracious England have I offer</span>  
> <span id="4.3.53">Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.54">When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.55">Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country</span>  
> <span id="4.3.56">Shall have more vices than it had before,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.57">More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.58">By him that shall succeed.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.59">What should he be?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.60">It is myself I mean: in whom I know</span>  
> <span id="4.3.61">All the particulars of vice so grafted</span>  
> <span id="4.3.62">That, when they shall be open'd, black
> Macbeth</span>  
> <span id="4.3.63">Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor
> state</span>  
> <span id="4.3.64">Esteem him as a lamb, being compared</span>  
> <span id="4.3.65">With my confineless harms.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.66">Not in the legions</span>  
> <span id="4.3.67">Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd</span>  
> <span id="4.3.68">In evils to top Macbeth.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.69">I grant him bloody,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.70">Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.71">Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin</span>  
> <span id="4.3.72">That has a name: but there's no bottom,
> none,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.73">In my voluptuousness: your wives, your
> daughters,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.74">Your matrons and your maids, could not fill
> up</span>  
> <span id="4.3.75">The cistern of my lust, and my desire</span>  
> <span id="4.3.76">All continent impediments would o'erbear</span>  
> <span id="4.3.77">That did oppose my will: better Macbeth</span>  
> <span id="4.3.78">Than such an one to reign.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.79">Boundless intemperance</span>  
> <span id="4.3.80">In nature is a tyranny; it hath been</span>  
> <span id="4.3.81">The untimely emptying of the happy throne</span>  
> <span id="4.3.82">And fall of many kings. But fear not yet</span>  
> <span id="4.3.83">To take upon you what is yours: you may</span>  
> <span id="4.3.84">Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.85">And yet seem cold, the time you may so
> hoodwink.</span>  
> <span id="4.3.86">We have willing dames enough: there cannot
> be</span>  
> <span id="4.3.87">That vulture in you, to devour so many</span>  
> <span id="4.3.88">As will to greatness dedicate themselves,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.89">Finding it so inclined.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.90">With this there grows</span>  
> <span id="4.3.91">In my most ill-composed affection such</span>  
> <span id="4.3.92">A stanchless avarice that, were I king,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.93">I should cut off the nobles for their
> lands,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.94">Desire his jewels and this other's house:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.95">And my more-having would be as a sauce</span>  
> <span id="4.3.96">To make me hunger more; that I should forge</span>  
> <span id="4.3.97">Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.98">Destroying them for wealth.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.99">This avarice</span>  
> <span id="4.3.100">Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious
> root</span>  
> <span id="4.3.101">Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been</span>  
> <span id="4.3.102">The sword of our slain kings: yet do not
> fear;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.103">Scotland hath foisons to fill up your
> will.</span>  
> <span id="4.3.104">Of your mere own: all these are portable,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.105">With other graces weigh'd.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.106">But I have none: the king-becoming graces,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.107">As justice, verity, temperance,
> stableness,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.108">Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.109">Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.110">I have no relish of them, but abound</span>  
> <span id="4.3.111">In the division of each several crime,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.112">Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I
> should</span>  
> <span id="4.3.113">Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.114">Uproar the universal peace, confound</span>  
> <span id="4.3.115">All unity on earth.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.116">O Scotland, Scotland!</span>  

<span id="speech19">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.117">If such a one be fit to govern, speak:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.118">I am as I have spoken.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.119">Fit to govern!</span>  
> <span id="4.3.120">No, not to live. O nation miserable,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.121">With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.122">When shalt thou see thy wholesome days
> again,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.123">Since that the truest issue of thy throne</span>  
> <span id="4.3.124">By his own interdiction stands accursed,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.125">And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal
> father</span>  
> <span id="4.3.126">Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore
> thee,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.127">Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.128">Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!</span>  
> <span id="4.3.129">These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself</span>  
> <span id="4.3.130">Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my
> breast,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.131">Thy hope ends here!</span>  

<span id="speech21">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.132">Macduff, this noble passion,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.133">Child of integrity, hath from my soul</span>  
> <span id="4.3.134">Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my
> thoughts</span>  
> <span id="4.3.135">To thy good truth and honour. Devilish
> Macbeth</span>  
> <span id="4.3.136">By many of these trains hath sought to win
> me</span>  
> <span id="4.3.137">Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks
> me</span>  
> <span id="4.3.138">From over-credulous haste: but God above</span>  
> <span id="4.3.139">Deal between thee and me! for even now</span>  
> <span id="4.3.140">I put myself to thy direction, and</span>  
> <span id="4.3.141">Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure</span>  
> <span id="4.3.142">The taints and blames I laid upon myself,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.143">For strangers to my nature. I am yet</span>  
> <span id="4.3.144">Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.145">Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.146">At no time broke my faith, would not
> betray</span>  
> <span id="4.3.147">The devil to his fellow and delight</span>  
> <span id="4.3.148">No less in truth than life: my first false
> speaking</span>  
> <span id="4.3.149">Was this upon myself: what I am truly,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.150">Is thine and my poor country's to command:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.151">Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.152">Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.153">Already at a point, was setting forth.</span>  
> <span id="4.3.154">Now we'll together; and the chance of
> goodness</span>  
> <span id="4.3.155">Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you

<span id="speech22">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.156">Such welcome and unwelcome things at once</span>  
> <span id="4.3.157">'Tis hard to reconcile.</span>

> *Enter a Doctor*

<span id="speech23">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.158">Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray

<span id="speech24">**Doctor**</span>

> <span id="4.3.159">Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched

> <span id="4.3.160">That stay his cure: their malady convinces</span>  
> <span id="4.3.161">The great assay of art; but at his touch--</span>

> <span id="4.3.163">They presently amend.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.164">I thank you, doctor.</span>  
>
> *Exit Doctor*

<span id="speech26">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.165">What's the disease he means?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.166">'Tis call'd the evil:</span>  
> <span id="4.3.167">A most miraculous work in this good king;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.168">Which often, since my here-remain in
> England,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.169">I have seen him do. How he solicits

> <span id="4.3.170">Himself best knows: but strangely-visited

> <span id="4.3.171">All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the

> <span id="4.3.172">The mere despair of surgery, he cures,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.173">Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.174">Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.175">To the succeeding royalty he leaves</span>  
> <span id="4.3.176">The healing benediction. With this strange

> *Enter ROSS*

<span id="speech28">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.180">See, who comes here?</span>  

<span id="speech29">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.181">My countryman; but yet I know him not.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.182">My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.183">I know him now. Good God, betimes remove</span>

<span id="speech32">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.185">Sir, amen.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.186">Stands Scotland where it did?</span>  

<span id="speech34">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.187">Alas, poor country!</span>  
> <span id="4.3.188">Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot</span>  
> <span id="4.3.189">Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where
> nothing,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.190">But who knows nothing, is once seen to
> smile;</span>  
> <span id="4.3.191">Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the
> air</span>  
> <span id="4.3.192">Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow
> seems</span>  
> <span id="4.3.193">A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell</span>  
> <span id="4.3.194">Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's

> <span id="4.3.195">Expire before the flowers in their caps,</span>

<span id="speech35">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.197">O, relation</span>  
> <span id="4.3.198">Too nice, and yet too true!</span>  

<span id="speech36">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.199">What's the newest grief?</span>  

<span id="speech37">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.200">That of an hour's age doth hiss the

<span id="speech38">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.202">How does my wife?</span>  

<span id="speech39">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.203">Why, well.</span>  

<span id="speech40">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.204">And all my children?</span>  

<span id="speech41">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.205">Well too.</span>  

<span id="speech42">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.206">The tyrant has not batter'd at their

<span id="speech43">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.207">No; they were well at peace when I did leave

<span id="speech44">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.208">But not a niggard of your speech: how

<span id="speech45">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.209">When I came hither to transport the

> <span id="4.3.215">Would create soldiers, make our women

<span id="speech46">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="4.3.217">Be't their comfort</span>

<span id="speech47">**ROSS**</span>

<span id="speech48">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.226">What concern they?</span>  
> <span id="4.3.227">The general cause? or is it a fee-grief</span>  
> <span id="4.3.228">Due to some single breast?</span>  

<span id="speech49">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.229">No mind that's honest</span>  
> <span id="4.3.230">But in it shares some woe; though the main

> <span id="4.3.231">Pertains to you alone.</span>  

<span id="speech50">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.3.232">If it be mine,</span>  
> <span id="4.3.233">Keep it not from me, quickly let me have

<span id="speech51">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.234">Let not your ears despise my tongue for

> <span id="4.3.237">Hum! I guess at it.</span>  

<span id="speech53">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.3.238">Your castle is surprised; your wife and
