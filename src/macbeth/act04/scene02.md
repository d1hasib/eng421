## SCENE II

### Fife. Macduff's castle.

> *Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS*

<span id="speech1">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.1">What had he done, to make him fly the land?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.2">You must have patience, madam.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.3">He had none:</span>  
> <span id="4.2.4">His flight was madness: when our actions do
> not,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.5">Our fears do make us traitors.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.6">You know not</span>  
> <span id="4.2.7">Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.8">Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his
> babes,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.9">His mansion and his titles in a place</span>  
> <span id="4.2.10">From whence himself does fly? He loves us
> not;</span>  
> <span id="4.2.11">He wants the natural touch: for the poor
> wren,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.12">The most diminutive of birds, will fight,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.13">Her young ones in her nest, against the
> owl.</span>  
> <span id="4.2.14">All is the fear and nothing is the love;</span>  
> <span id="4.2.15">As little is the wisdom, where the flight</span>  
> <span id="4.2.16">So runs against all reason.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.17">My dearest coz,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.18">I pray you, school yourself: but for your
> husband,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.19">He is noble, wise, judicious, and best
> knows</span>  
> <span id="4.2.20">The fits o' the season. I dare not speak</span>  
> <span id="4.2.21">much further;</span>  
> <span id="4.2.22">But cruel are the times, when we are
> traitors</span>  
> <span id="4.2.23">And do not know ourselves, when we hold
> rumour</span>  
> <span id="4.2.24">From what we fear, yet know not what we
> fear,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.25">But float upon a wild and violent sea</span>  
> <span id="4.2.26">Each way and move. I take my leave of you:</span>  
> <span id="4.2.27">Shall not be long but I'll be here again:</span>  
> <span id="4.2.28">Things at the worst will cease, or else climb
> upward</span>  
> <span id="4.2.29">To what they were before. My pretty cousin,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.30">Blessing upon you!</span>  

<span id="speech7">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.31">Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="4.2.32">I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.33">It would be my disgrace and your
> discomfort:</span>  
> <span id="4.2.34">I take my leave at once.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech9">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.35">Sirrah, your father's dead;</span>  
> <span id="4.2.36">And what will you do now? How will you
> live?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.37">As birds do, mother.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.38">What, with worms and flies?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.39">With what I get, I mean; and so do they.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.40">Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor
> lime,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.41">The pitfall nor the gin.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.42">Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set
> for.</span>  
> <span id="4.2.43">My father is not dead, for all your saying.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.44">Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a
> father?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.45">Nay, how will you do for a husband?</span>  

<span id="speech17">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.46">Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.47">Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.48">Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i'
> faith,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.49">With wit enough for thee.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.50">Was my father a traitor, mother?</span>  

<span id="speech21">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.51">Ay, that he was.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.52">What is a traitor?</span>  

<span id="speech23">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.53">Why, one that swears and lies.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.54">And be all traitors that do so?</span>  

<span id="speech25">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.55">Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be
> hanged.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.56">And must they all be hanged that swear and
> lie?</span>  

<span id="speech27">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.57">Every one.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.58">Who must hang them?</span>  

<span id="speech29">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.59">Why, the honest men.</span>  

<span id="speech30">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.60">Then the liars and swearers are fools,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.61">for there are liars and swearers enow to
> beat</span>  
> <span id="4.2.62">the honest men and hang up them.</span>  

<span id="speech31">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.63">Now, God help thee, poor monkey!</span>  
> <span id="4.2.64">But how wilt thou do for a father?</span>  

<span id="speech32">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.65">If he were dead, you'ld weep for</span>  
> <span id="4.2.66">him: if you would not, it were a good sign</span>  
> <span id="4.2.67">that I should quickly have a new father.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.68">Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!</span>  
>
> *Enter a Messenger*

<span id="speech34">**Messenger**</span>

> <span id="4.2.69">Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you
> known,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.70">Though in your state of honour I am
> perfect.</span>  
> <span id="4.2.71">I doubt some danger does approach you
> nearly:</span>  
> <span id="4.2.72">If you will take a homely man's advice,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.73">Be not found here; hence, with your little
> ones.</span>  
> <span id="4.2.74">To fright you thus, methinks, I am too
> savage;</span>  
> <span id="4.2.75">To do worse to you were fell cruelty,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.76">Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve
> you!</span>  
> <span id="4.2.77">I dare abide no longer.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech35">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.78">Whither should I fly?</span>  
> <span id="4.2.79">I have done no harm. But I remember now</span>  
> <span id="4.2.80">I am in this earthly world; where to do
> harm</span>  
> <span id="4.2.81">Is often laudable, to do good sometime</span>  
> <span id="4.2.82">Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.83">Do I put up that womanly defence,</span>  
> <span id="4.2.84">To say I have done no harm?</span>  
>
> *Enter Murderers*
>
> <span id="4.2.85">What are these faces?</span>  

<span id="speech36">**First Murderer**</span>

> <span id="4.2.86">Where is your husband?</span>  

<span id="speech37">**LADY MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="4.2.87">I hope, in no place so unsanctified</span>  
> <span id="4.2.88">Where such as thou mayst find him.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**First Murderer**</span>

> <span id="4.2.89">He's a traitor.</span>  

<span id="speech39">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.90">Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!</span>  

<span id="speech40">**First Murderer**</span>

> <span id="4.2.91">What, you egg!</span>  
>
> *Stabbing him*
>
> <span id="4.2.92">Young fry of treachery!</span>  

<span id="speech41">**Son**</span>

> <span id="4.2.93">He has kill'd me, mother:</span>  
> <span id="4.2.94">Run away, I pray you!</span>  
>
> *Dies*
>
> *Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt Murderers, following her*
