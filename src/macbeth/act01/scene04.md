## SCENE IV 

### Forres. The palace.

> *Flourish. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, and Attendants*

<span id="speech1">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.4.1">Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not</span>  
> <span id="1.4.2">Those in commission yet return'd?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="1.4.3">My liege,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.4">They are not yet come back. But I have spoke</span>  
> <span id="1.4.5">With one that saw him die: who did report</span>  
> <span id="1.4.6">That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.7">Implored your highness' pardon and set forth</span>  
> <span id="1.4.8">A deep repentance: nothing in his life</span>  
> <span id="1.4.9">Became him like the leaving it; he died</span>  
> <span id="1.4.10">As one that had been studied in his death</span>  
> <span id="1.4.11">To throw away the dearest thing he owed,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.12">As 'twere a careless trifle.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.4.13">There's no art</span>  
> <span id="1.4.14">To find the mind's construction in the
> face:</span>  
> <span id="1.4.15">He was a gentleman on whom I built</span>  
> <span id="1.4.16">An absolute trust.</span>  
>
> *Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS*
>
> <span id="1.4.17">O worthiest cousin!</span>  
> <span id="1.4.18">The sin of my ingratitude even now</span>  
> <span id="1.4.19">Was heavy on me: thou art so far before</span>  
> <span id="1.4.20">That swiftest wing of recompense is slow</span>  
> <span id="1.4.21">To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less
> deserved,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.22">That the proportion both of thanks and
> payment</span>  
> <span id="1.4.23">Might have been mine! only I have left to
> say,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.24">More is thy due than more than all can pay.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.4.25">The service and the loyalty I owe,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.26">In doing it, pays itself. Your highness'
> part</span>  
> <span id="1.4.27">Is to receive our duties; and our duties</span>  
> <span id="1.4.28">Are to your throne and state children and
> servants,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.29">Which do but what they should, by doing every
> thing</span>  
> <span id="1.4.30">Safe toward your love and honour.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.4.31">Welcome hither:</span>  
> <span id="1.4.32">I have begun to plant thee, and will labour</span>  
> <span id="1.4.33">To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.34">That hast no less deserved, nor must be
> known</span>  
> <span id="1.4.35">No less to have done so, let me enfold thee</span>  
> <span id="1.4.36">And hold thee to my heart.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.4.37">There if I grow,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.38">The harvest is your own.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.4.39">My plenteous joys,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.40">Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves</span>  
> <span id="1.4.41">In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.42">And you whose places are the nearest, know</span>  
> <span id="1.4.43">We will establish our estate upon</span>  
> <span id="1.4.44">Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter</span>  
> <span id="1.4.45">The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must</span>  
> <span id="1.4.46">Not unaccompanied invest him only,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.47">But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall
> shine</span>  
> <span id="1.4.48">On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.49">And bind us further to you.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.4.50">The rest is labour, which is not used for
> you:</span>  
> <span id="1.4.51">I'll be myself the harbinger and make
> joyful</span>  
> <span id="1.4.52">The hearing of my wife with your approach;</span>  
> <span id="1.4.53">So humbly take my leave.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.4.54">My worthy Cawdor!</span>  

<span id="speech10">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.4.55">\[Aside\] The Prince of Cumberland! that is a
> step</span>  
> <span id="1.4.56">On which I must fall down, or else
> o'erleap,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.57">For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your
> fires;</span>  
> <span id="1.4.58">Let not light see my black and deep
> desires:</span>  
> <span id="1.4.59">The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.60">Which the eye fears, when it is done, to
> see.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech11">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.4.61">True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.62">And in his commendations I am fed;</span>  
> <span id="1.4.63">It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,</span>  
> <span id="1.4.64">Whose care is gone before to bid us
> welcome:</span>  
> <span id="1.4.65">It is a peerless kinsman.</span>  
>
> *Flourish. Exeunt*
