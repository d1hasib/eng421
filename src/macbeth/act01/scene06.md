## SCENE VI 

### Before Macbeth's castle.

> *Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, BANQUO,
> LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS, and Attendants*

<span id="speech1">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.6.1">This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air</span>  
> <span id="1.6.2">Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself</span>  
> <span id="1.6.3">Unto our gentle senses.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.6.4">This guest of summer,</span>  
> <span id="1.6.5">The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,</span>  
> <span id="1.6.6">By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's
> breath</span>  
> <span id="1.6.7">Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,</span>  
> <span id="1.6.8">Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this
> bird</span>  
> <span id="1.6.9">Hath made his pendent bed and procreant
> cradle:</span>  
> <span id="1.6.10">Where they most breed and haunt, I have
> observed,</span>  
> <span id="1.6.11">The air is delicate.</span>  
>
> *Enter LADY MACBETH*

<span id="speech3">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.6.12">See, see, our honour'd hostess!</span>  
> <span id="1.6.13">The love that follows us sometime is our
> trouble,</span>  
> <span id="1.6.14">Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach
> you</span>  
> <span id="1.6.15">How you shall bid God 'ild us for your
> pains,</span>  
> <span id="1.6.16">And thank us for your trouble.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.6.17">All our service</span>  
> <span id="1.6.18">In every point twice done and then done
> double</span>  
> <span id="1.6.19">Were poor and single business to contend</span>  
> <span id="1.6.20">Against those honours deep and broad
> wherewith</span>  
> <span id="1.6.21">Your majesty loads our house: for those of
> old,</span>  
> <span id="1.6.22">And the late dignities heap'd up to them,</span>  
> <span id="1.6.23">We rest your hermits.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.6.24">Where's the thane of Cawdor?</span>  
> <span id="1.6.25">We coursed him at the heels, and had a
> purpose</span>  
> <span id="1.6.26">To be his purveyor: but he rides well;</span>  
> <span id="1.6.27">And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp
> him</span>  
> <span id="1.6.28">To his home before us. Fair and noble
> hostess,</span>  
> <span id="1.6.29">We are your guest to-night.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.6.30">Your servants ever</span>  
> <span id="1.6.31">Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in
> compt,</span>  
> <span id="1.6.32">To make their audit at your highness'
> pleasure,</span>  
> <span id="1.6.33">Still to return your own.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.6.34">Give me your hand;</span>  
> <span id="1.6.35">Conduct me to mine host: we love him
> highly,</span>  
> <span id="1.6.36">And shall continue our graces towards him.</span>  
> <span id="1.6.37">By your leave, hostess.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
