## SCENE VII 

### Macbeth's castle.

> *Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers Servants with dishes
> and service, and pass over the stage. Then enter MACBETH*

<span id="speech1">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.7.1">If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere
> well</span>  
> <span id="1.7.2">It were done quickly: if the assassination</span>  
> <span id="1.7.3">Could trammel up the consequence, and catch</span>  
> <span id="1.7.4">With his surcease success; that but this
> blow</span>  
> <span id="1.7.5">Might be the be-all and the end-all here,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.6">But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.7">We'ld jump the life to come. But in these
> cases</span>  
> <span id="1.7.8">We still have judgment here; that we but
> teach</span>  
> <span id="1.7.9">Bloody instructions, which, being taught,
> return</span>  
> <span id="1.7.10">To plague the inventor: this even-handed
> justice</span>  
> <span id="1.7.11">Commends the ingredients of our poison'd
> chalice</span>  
> <span id="1.7.12">To our own lips. He's here in double trust;</span>  
> <span id="1.7.13">First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.14">Strong both against the deed; then, as his
> host,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.15">Who should against his murderer shut the
> door,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.16">Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this
> Duncan</span>  
> <span id="1.7.17">Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been</span>  
> <span id="1.7.18">So clear in his great office, that his
> virtues</span>  
> <span id="1.7.19">Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued,
> against</span>  
> <span id="1.7.20">The deep damnation of his taking-off;</span>  
> <span id="1.7.21">And pity, like a naked new-born babe,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.22">Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim,
> horsed</span>  
> <span id="1.7.23">Upon the sightless couriers of the air,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.24">Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.25">That tears shall drown the wind. I have no
> spur</span>  
> <span id="1.7.26">To prick the sides of my intent, but only</span>  
> <span id="1.7.27">Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself</span>  
> <span id="1.7.28">And falls on the other.</span>  
>
> *Enter LADY MACBETH*
>
> <span id="1.7.29">How now! what news?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.7.30">He has almost supp'd: why have you left the
> chamber?</span>  

<span id="speech3">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.7.31">Hath he ask'd for me?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.7.32">Know you not he has?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.7.33">We will proceed no further in this
> business:</span>  
> <span id="1.7.34">He hath honour'd me of late; and I have
> bought</span>  
> <span id="1.7.35">Golden opinions from all sorts of people,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.36">Which would be worn now in their newest
> gloss,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.37">Not cast aside so soon.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.7.38">Was the hope drunk</span>  
> <span id="1.7.39">Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept
> since?</span>  
> <span id="1.7.40">And wakes it now, to look so green and pale</span>  
> <span id="1.7.41">At what it did so freely? From this time</span>  
> <span id="1.7.42">Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard</span>  
> <span id="1.7.43">To be the same in thine own act and valour</span>  
> <span id="1.7.44">As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have
> that</span>  
> <span id="1.7.45">Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.46">And live a coward in thine own esteem,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.47">Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'</span>  
> <span id="1.7.48">Like the poor cat i' the adage?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.7.49">Prithee, peace:</span>  
> <span id="1.7.50">I dare do all that may become a man;</span>  
> <span id="1.7.51">Who dares do more is none.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.7.52">What beast was't, then,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.53">That made you break this enterprise to me?</span>  
> <span id="1.7.54">When you durst do it, then you were a man;</span>  
> <span id="1.7.55">And, to be more than what you were, you
> would</span>  
> <span id="1.7.56">Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place</span>  
> <span id="1.7.57">Did then adhere, and yet you would make
> both:</span>  
> <span id="1.7.58">They have made themselves, and that their fitness
> now</span>  
> <span id="1.7.59">Does unmake you. I have given suck, and
> know</span>  
> <span id="1.7.60">How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks
> me:</span>  
> <span id="1.7.61">I would, while it was smiling in my face,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.62">Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless
> gums,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.63">And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as
> you</span>  
> <span id="1.7.64">Have done to this.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.7.65">If we should fail?</span>  

<span id="speech10">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.7.66">We fail!</span>  
> <span id="1.7.67">But screw your courage to the
> sticking-place,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.68">And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--</span>  
> <span id="1.7.69">Whereto the rather shall his day's hard
> journey</span>  
> <span id="1.7.70">Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains</span>  
> <span id="1.7.71">Will I with wine and wassail so convince</span>  
> <span id="1.7.72">That memory, the warder of the brain,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.73">Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason</span>  
> <span id="1.7.74">A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep</span>  
> <span id="1.7.75">Their drenched natures lie as in a death,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.76">What cannot you and I perform upon</span>  
> <span id="1.7.77">The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon</span>  
> <span id="1.7.78">His spongy officers, who shall bear the
> guilt</span>  
> <span id="1.7.79">Of our great quell?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.7.80">Bring forth men-children only;</span>  
> <span id="1.7.81">For thy undaunted mettle should compose</span>  
> <span id="1.7.82">Nothing but males. Will it not be received,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.83">When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy
> two</span>  
> <span id="1.7.84">Of his own chamber and used their very
> daggers,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.85">That they have done't?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.7.86">Who dares receive it other,</span>  
> <span id="1.7.87">As we shall make our griefs and clamour
> roar</span>  
> <span id="1.7.88">Upon his death?</span>  

<span id="speech13">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.7.89">I am settled, and bend up</span>  
> <span id="1.7.90">Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.</span>  
> <span id="1.7.91">Away, and mock the time with fairest show:</span>  
> <span id="1.7.92">False face must hide what the false heart doth
> know.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
