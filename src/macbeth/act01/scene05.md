> *Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letter*

<span id="speech1">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.5.1">'They met me in the day of success: and I
> have</span>  
> <span id="1.5.2">learned by the perfectest report, they have more
> in</span>  
> <span id="1.5.3">them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in
> desire</span>  
> <span id="1.5.4">to question them further, they made themselves
> air,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.5">into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt
> in</span>  
> <span id="1.5.6">the wonder of it, came missives from the king,
> who</span>  
> <span id="1.5.7">all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which
> title,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.8">before, these weird sisters saluted me, and
> referred</span>  
> <span id="1.5.9">me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king
> that</span>  
> <span id="1.5.10">shalt be!' This have I thought good to
> deliver</span>  
> <span id="1.5.11">thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that
> thou</span>  
> <span id="1.5.12">mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by
> being</span>  
> <span id="1.5.13">ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay
> it</span>  
> <span id="1.5.14">to thy heart, and farewell.'</span>  
> <span id="1.5.15">Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be</span>  
> <span id="1.5.16">What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy
> nature;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.17">It is too full o' the milk of human
> kindness</span>  
> <span id="1.5.18">To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be
> great;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.19">Art not without ambition, but without</span>  
> <span id="1.5.20">The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst
> highly,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.21">That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play
> false,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.22">And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great
> Glamis,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.23">That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have
> it;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.24">And that which rather thou dost fear to do</span>  
> <span id="1.5.25">Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee
> hither,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.26">That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.27">And chastise with the valour of my tongue</span>  
> <span id="1.5.28">All that impedes thee from the golden
> round,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.29">Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem</span>  
> <span id="1.5.30">To have thee crown'd withal.</span>  
>
> *Enter a Messenger*
>
> <span id="1.5.31">What is your tidings?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Messenger**</span>

> <span id="1.5.32">The king comes here to-night.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.5.33">Thou'rt mad to say it:</span>  
> <span id="1.5.34">Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.35">Would have inform'd for preparation.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**Messenger**</span>

> <span id="1.5.36">So please you, it is true: our thane is
> coming:</span>  
> <span id="1.5.37">One of my fellows had the speed of him,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.38">Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely
> more</span>  
> <span id="1.5.39">Than would make up his message.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.5.40">Give him tending;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.41">He brings great news.</span>  
>
> *Exit Messenger*
>
> <span id="1.5.42">The raven himself is hoarse</span>  
> <span id="1.5.43">That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan</span>  
> <span id="1.5.44">Under my battlements. Come, you spirits</span>  
> <span id="1.5.45">That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me
> here,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.46">And fill me from the crown to the toe
> top-full</span>  
> <span id="1.5.47">Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.48">Stop up the access and passage to remorse,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.49">That no compunctious visitings of nature</span>  
> <span id="1.5.50">Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace
> between</span>  
> <span id="1.5.51">The effect and it! Come to my woman's
> breasts,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.52">And take my milk for gall, you murdering
> ministers,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.53">Wherever in your sightless substances</span>  
> <span id="1.5.54">You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick
> night,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.55">And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.56">That my keen knife see not the wound it
> makes,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.57">Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the
> dark,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.58">To cry 'Hold, hold!'</span>  
>
> *Enter MACBETH*
>
> <span id="1.5.59">Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!</span>  
> <span id="1.5.60">Greater than both, by the all-hail
> hereafter!</span>  
> <span id="1.5.61">Thy letters have transported me beyond</span>  
> <span id="1.5.62">This ignorant present, and I feel now</span>  
> <span id="1.5.63">The future in the instant.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.5.64">My dearest love,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.65">Duncan comes here to-night.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.5.66">And when goes hence?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.5.67">To-morrow, as he purposes.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.5.68">O, never</span>  
> <span id="1.5.69">Shall sun that morrow see!</span>  
> <span id="1.5.70">Your face, my thane, is as a book where men</span>  
> <span id="1.5.71">May read strange matters. To beguile the
> time,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.72">Look like the time; bear welcome in your
> eye,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.73">Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent
> flower,</span>  
> <span id="1.5.74">But be the serpent under't. He that's
> coming</span>  
> <span id="1.5.75">Must be provided for: and you shall put</span>  
> <span id="1.5.76">This night's great business into my
> dispatch;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.77">Which shall to all our nights and days to
> come</span>  
> <span id="1.5.78">Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.5.79">We will speak further.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.5.80">Only look up clear;</span>  
> <span id="1.5.81">To alter favour ever is to fear:</span>  
> <span id="1.5.82">Leave all the rest to me.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
