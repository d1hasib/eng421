## SCENE II

### A camp near Forres.

> *Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with
> Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant*

<span id="speech1">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.2.1">What bloody man is that? He can report,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.2">As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt</span>  
> <span id="1.2.3">The newest state.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.4">This is the sergeant</span>  
> <span id="1.2.5">Who like a good and hardy soldier fought</span>  
> <span id="1.2.6">'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!</span>  
> <span id="1.2.7">Say to the king the knowledge of the broil</span>  
> <span id="1.2.8">As thou didst leave it.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**Sergeant**</span>

> <span id="1.2.9">Doubtful it stood;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.10">As two spent swimmers, that do cling
> together</span>  
> <span id="1.2.11">And choke their art. The merciless
> Macdonwald--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.12">Worthy to be a rebel, for to that</span>  
> <span id="1.2.13">The multiplying villanies of nature</span>  
> <span id="1.2.14">Do swarm upon him--from the western isles</span>  
> <span id="1.2.15">Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.16">And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.17">Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too
> weak:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.18">For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that
> name--</span>  
> <span id="1.2.19">Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd
> steel,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.20">Which smoked with bloody execution,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.21">Like valour's minion carved out his passage</span>  
> <span id="1.2.22">Till he faced the slave;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.23">Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to
> him,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.24">Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the
> chaps,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.25">And fix'd his head upon our battlements.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.2.26">O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!</span>  

<span id="speech5">**Sergeant**</span>

> <span id="1.2.27">As whence the sun 'gins his reflection</span>  
> <span id="1.2.28">Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders
> break,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.29">So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to
> come</span>  
> <span id="1.2.30">Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland,
> mark:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.31">No sooner justice had with valour arm'd</span>  
> <span id="1.2.32">Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their
> heels,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.33">But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.34">With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men</span>  
> <span id="1.2.35">Began a fresh assault.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.2.36">Dismay'd not this</span>  
> <span id="1.2.37">Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**Sergeant**</span>

> <span id="1.2.38">Yes;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.39">As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.40">If I say sooth, I must report they were</span>  
> <span id="1.2.41">As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so
> they</span>  
> <span id="1.2.42">Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.43">Except they meant to bathe in reeking
> wounds,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.44">Or memorise another Golgotha,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.45">I cannot tell.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.46">But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.2.47">So well thy words become thee as thy
> wounds;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.48">They smack of honour both. Go get him
> surgeons.</span>  
>
> *Exit Sergeant, attended*
>
> <span id="1.2.49">Who comes here?</span>  
>
> *Enter ROSS*

<span id="speech9">**MALCOLM**</span>

> <span id="1.2.50">The worthy thane of Ross.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="1.2.51">What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he
> look</span>  
> <span id="1.2.52">That seems to speak things strange.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.53">God save the king!</span>  

<span id="speech12">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.2.54">Whence camest thou, worthy thane?</span>  

<span id="speech13">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.55">From Fife, great king;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.56">Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky</span>  
> <span id="1.2.57">And fan our people cold. Norway himself,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.58">With terrible numbers,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.59">Assisted by that most disloyal traitor</span>  
> <span id="1.2.60">The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal
> conflict;</span>  
> <span id="1.2.61">Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in
> proof,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.62">Confronted him with self-comparisons,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.63">Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst
> arm.</span>  
> <span id="1.2.64">Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to
> conclude,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.65">The victory fell on us.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.2.66">Great happiness!</span>  

<span id="speech15">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.67">That now</span>  
> <span id="1.2.68">Sweno, the Norways' king, craves
> composition:</span>  
> <span id="1.2.69">Nor would we deign him burial of his men</span>  
> <span id="1.2.70">Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch</span>  
> <span id="1.2.71">Ten thousand dollars to our general use.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.2.72">No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive</span>  
> <span id="1.2.73">Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present
> death,</span>  
> <span id="1.2.74">And with his former title greet Macbeth.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="1.2.75">I'll see it done.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**DUNCAN**</span>

> <span id="1.2.76">What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
