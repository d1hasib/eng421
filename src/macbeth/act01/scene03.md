## SCENE III 

### A heath near Forres.

> *Thunder. Enter the three Witches*

<span id="speech1">**First Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.1">Where hast thou been, sister?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**Second Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.2">Killing swine.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**Third Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.3">Sister, where thou?</span>  

<span id="speech4">**First Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.4">A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.5">And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--</span>  
> <span id="1.3.6">'Give me,' quoth I:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.7">'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon
> cries.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.8">Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the
> Tiger:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.9">But in a sieve I'll thither sail,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.10">And, like a rat without a tail,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.11">I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**Second Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.12">I'll give thee a wind.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**First Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.13">Thou'rt kind.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**Third Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.14">And I another.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**First Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.15">I myself have all the other,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.16">And the very ports they blow,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.17">All the quarters that they know</span>  
> <span id="1.3.18">I' the shipman's card.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.19">I will drain him dry as hay:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.20">Sleep shall neither night nor day</span>  
> <span id="1.3.21">Hang upon his pent-house lid;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.22">He shall live a man forbid:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.23">Weary se'nnights nine times nine</span>  
> <span id="1.3.24">Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.25">Though his bark cannot be lost,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.26">Yet it shall be tempest-tost.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.27">Look what I have.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**Second Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.28">Show me, show me.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**First Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.29">Here I have a pilot's thumb,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.30">Wreck'd as homeward he did come.</span>  
>
> *Drum within*

<span id="speech11">**Third Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.31">A drum, a drum!</span>  
> <span id="1.3.32">Macbeth doth come.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**ALL**</span>

> <span id="1.3.33">The weird sisters, hand in hand,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.34">Posters of the sea and land,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.35">Thus do go about, about:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.36">Thrice to thine and thrice to mine</span>  
> <span id="1.3.37">And thrice again, to make up nine.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.38">Peace! the charm's wound up.</span>  
>
> *Enter MACBETH and BANQUO*

<span id="speech13">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.3.39">So foul and fair a day I have not seen.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.40">How far is't call'd to Forres? What are
> these</span>  
> <span id="1.3.41">So wither'd and so wild in their attire,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.42">That look not like the inhabitants o' the
> earth,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.43">And yet are on't? Live you? or are you
> aught</span>  
> <span id="1.3.44">That man may question? You seem to understand
> me,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.45">By each at once her chappy finger laying</span>  
> <span id="1.3.46">Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.47">And yet your beards forbid me to interpret</span>  
> <span id="1.3.48">That you are so.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.3.49">Speak, if you can: what are you?</span>  

<span id="speech16">**First Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.50">All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of
> Glamis!</span>  

<span id="speech17">**Second Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.51">All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of
> Cawdor!</span>  

<span id="speech18">**Third Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.52">All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king
> hereafter!</span>  

<span id="speech19">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.53">Good sir, why do you start; and seem to
> fear</span>  
> <span id="1.3.54">Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of
> truth,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.55">Are ye fantastical, or that indeed</span>  
> <span id="1.3.56">Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner</span>  
> <span id="1.3.57">You greet with present grace and great
> prediction</span>  
> <span id="1.3.58">Of noble having and of royal hope,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.59">That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak
> not.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.60">If you can look into the seeds of time,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.61">And say which grain will grow and which will
> not,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.62">Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear</span>  
> <span id="1.3.63">Your favours nor your hate.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**First Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.64">Hail!</span>  

<span id="speech21">**Second Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.65">Hail!</span>  

<span id="speech22">**Third Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.66">Hail!</span>  

<span id="speech23">**First Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.67">Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**Second Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.68">Not so happy, yet much happier.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**Third Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.69">Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.70">So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!</span>  

<span id="speech26">**First Witch**</span>

> <span id="1.3.71">Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!</span>  

<span id="speech27">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.3.72">Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.73">By Sinel's death I know I am thane of
> Glamis;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.74">But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor
> lives,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.75">A prosperous gentleman; and to be king</span>  
> <span id="1.3.76">Stands not within the prospect of belief,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.77">No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence</span>  
> <span id="1.3.78">You owe this strange intelligence? or why</span>  
> <span id="1.3.79">Upon this blasted heath you stop our way</span>  
> <span id="1.3.80">With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge
> you.</span>  
>
> *Witches vanish*

<span id="speech28">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.81">The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.82">And these are of them. Whither are they
> vanish'd?</span>  

<span id="speech29">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.3.83">Into the air; and what seem'd corporal
> melted</span>  
> <span id="1.3.84">As breath into the wind. Would they had
> stay'd!</span>  

<span id="speech30">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.85">Were such things here as we do speak about?</span>  
> <span id="1.3.86">Or have we eaten on the insane root</span>  
> <span id="1.3.87">That takes the reason prisoner?</span>  

<span id="speech31">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.3.88">Your children shall be kings.</span>  

<span id="speech32">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.89">You shall be king.</span>  

<span id="speech33">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.3.90">And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?</span>  

<span id="speech34">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.91">To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?</span>  
>
> *Enter ROSS and ANGUS*

<span id="speech35">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.92">The king hath happily received, Macbeth,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.93">The news of thy success; and when he reads</span>  
> <span id="1.3.94">Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.95">His wonders and his praises do contend</span>  
> <span id="1.3.96">Which should be thine or his: silenced with
> that,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.97">In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame
> day,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.98">He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.99">Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.100">Strange images of death. As thick as hail</span>  
> <span id="1.3.101">Came post with post; and every one did
> bear</span>  
> <span id="1.3.102">Thy praises in his kingdom's great
> defence,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.103">And pour'd them down before him.</span>  

<span id="speech36">**ANGUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.104">We are sent</span>  
> <span id="1.3.105">To give thee from our royal master thanks;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.106">Only to herald thee into his sight,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.107">Not pay thee.</span>  

<span id="speech37">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.108">And, for an earnest of a greater honour,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.109">He bade me, from him, call thee thane of
> Cawdor:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.110">In which addition, hail, most worthy
> thane!</span>  
> <span id="1.3.111">For it is thine.</span>  

<span id="speech38">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.112">What, can the devil speak true?</span>  

<span id="speech39">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.3.113">The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress
> me</span>  
> <span id="1.3.114">In borrow'd robes?</span>  

<span id="speech40">**ANGUS**</span>

> <span id="1.3.115">Who was the thane lives yet;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.116">But under heavy judgment bears that life</span>  
> <span id="1.3.117">Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was
> combined</span>  
> <span id="1.3.118">With those of Norway, or did line the
> rebel</span>  
> <span id="1.3.119">With hidden help and vantage, or that with
> both</span>  
> <span id="1.3.120">He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know
> not;</span>  
> <span id="1.3.121">But treasons capital, confess'd and
> proved,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.122">Have overthrown him.</span>  

<span id="speech41">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.3.123">\[Aside\] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!</span>  
> <span id="1.3.124">The greatest is behind.</span>  
>
> *To ROSS and ANGUS*
>
> <span id="1.3.125">Thanks for your pains.</span>  
>
> *To BANQUO*
>
> <span id="1.3.126">Do you not hope your children shall be
> kings,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.127">When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to
> me</span>  
> <span id="1.3.128">Promised no less to them?</span>  

<span id="speech42">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.129">That trusted home</span>  
> <span id="1.3.130">Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.131">Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis
> strange:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.132">And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.133">The instruments of darkness tell us
> truths,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.134">Win us with honest trifles, to betray's</span>  
> <span id="1.3.135">In deepest consequence.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.136">Cousins, a word, I pray you.</span>  

<span id="speech43">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.3.137">\[Aside\] Two truths are told,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.138">As happy prologues to the swelling act</span>  
> <span id="1.3.139">Of the imperial theme.--I thank you,
> gentlemen.</span>  
>
> *Aside*
>
> <span id="1.3.140">Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.141">Why hath it given me earnest of success,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.142">Commencing in a truth? I am thane of
> Cawdor:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.143">If good, why do I yield to that suggestion</span>  
> <span id="1.3.144">Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair</span>  
> <span id="1.3.145">And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.146">Against the use of nature? Present fears</span>  
> <span id="1.3.147">Are less than horrible imaginings:</span>  
> <span id="1.3.148">My thought, whose murder yet is but
> fantastical,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.149">Shakes so my single state of man that
> function</span>  
> <span id="1.3.150">Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is</span>  
> <span id="1.3.151">But what is not.</span>  

<span id="speech44">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.152">Look, how our partner's rapt.</span>  

<span id="speech45">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.3.153">\[Aside\] If chance will have me king, why, chance
> may crown me,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.154">Without my stir.</span>  

<span id="speech46">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.155">New horrors come upon him,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.156">Like our strange garments, cleave not to their
> mould</span>  
> <span id="1.3.157">But with the aid of use.</span>  

<span id="speech47">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.3.158">\[Aside\] Come what come may,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.159">Time and the hour runs through the roughest
> day.</span>  

<span id="speech48">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.160">Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.</span>  

<span id="speech49">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.3.161">Give me your favour: my dull brain was
> wrought</span>  
> <span id="1.3.162">With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your
> pains</span>  
> <span id="1.3.163">Are register'd where every day I turn</span>  
> <span id="1.3.164">The leaf to read them. Let us toward the
> king.</span>  
> <span id="1.3.165">Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more
> time,</span>  
> <span id="1.3.166">The interim having weigh'd it, let us
> speak</span>  
> <span id="1.3.167">Our free hearts each to other.</span>  

<span id="speech50">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="1.3.168">Very gladly.</span>  

<span id="speech51">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="1.3.169">Till then, enough. Come, friends.</span>

> *Exeunt*
