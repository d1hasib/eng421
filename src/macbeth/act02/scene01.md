> *Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him*

<span id="speech1">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.1">How goes the night, boy?</span>  

<span id="speech2">**FLEANCE**</span>

> <span id="2.1.2">The moon is down; I have not heard the
> clock.</span>  

<span id="speech3">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.3">And she goes down at twelve.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**FLEANCE**</span>

> <span id="2.1.4">I take't, 'tis later, sir.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.5">Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in
> heaven;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.6">Their candles are all out. Take thee that
> too.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.7">A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.8">And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.9">Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that
> nature</span>  
> <span id="2.1.10">Gives way to in repose!</span>  
>
> *Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch*
>
> <span id="2.1.11">Give me my sword.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.12">Who's there?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.1.13">A friend.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.14">What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's
> a-bed:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.15">He hath been in unusual pleasure, and</span>  
> <span id="2.1.16">Sent forth great largess to your offices.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.17">This diamond he greets your wife withal,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.18">By the name of most kind hostess; and shut
> up</span>  
> <span id="2.1.19">In measureless content.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.1.20">Being unprepared,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.21">Our will became the servant to defect;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.22">Which else should free have wrought.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.23">All's well.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.24">I dreamt last night of the three weird
> sisters:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.25">To you they have show'd some truth.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.1.26">I think not of them:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.27">Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.28">We would spend it in some words upon that
> business,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.29">If you would grant the time.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.30">At your kind'st leisure.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.1.31">If you shall cleave to my consent, when
> 'tis,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.32">It shall make honour for you.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.33">So I lose none</span>  
> <span id="2.1.34">In seeking to augment it, but still keep</span>  
> <span id="2.1.35">My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.36">I shall be counsell'd.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.1.37">Good repose the while!</span>  

<span id="speech15">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="2.1.38">Thanks, sir: the like to you!</span>  
>
> *Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE*

<span id="speech16">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.1.39">Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is
> ready,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.40">She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.</span>  
>
> *Exit Servant*
>
> <span id="2.1.41">Is this a dagger which I see before me,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.42">The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch
> thee.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.43">I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.44">Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible</span>  
> <span id="2.1.45">To feeling as to sight? or art thou but</span>  
> <span id="2.1.46">A dagger of the mind, a false creation,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.47">Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?</span>  
> <span id="2.1.48">I see thee yet, in form as palpable</span>  
> <span id="2.1.49">As this which now I draw.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.50">Thou marshall'st me the way that I was
> going;</span>  
> <span id="2.1.51">And such an instrument I was to use.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.52">Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other
> senses,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.53">Or else worth all the rest; I see thee
> still,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.54">And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of
> blood,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.55">Which was not so before. There's no such
> thing:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.56">It is the bloody business which informs</span>  
> <span id="2.1.57">Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one
> halfworld</span>  
> <span id="2.1.58">Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse</span>  
> <span id="2.1.59">The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates</span>  
> <span id="2.1.60">Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd
> murder,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.61">Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.62">Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy
> pace.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.63">With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his
> design</span>  
> <span id="2.1.64">Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set
> earth,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.65">Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for
> fear</span>  
> <span id="2.1.66">Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.67">And take the present horror from the time,</span>  
> <span id="2.1.68">Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he
> lives:</span>  
> <span id="2.1.69">Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath
> gives.</span>  
>
> *A bell rings*
>
> <span id="2.1.70">I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.</span>  
> <span id="2.1.71">Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell</span>  
> <span id="2.1.72">That summons thee to heaven or to hell.</span>  
>
> *Exit*
