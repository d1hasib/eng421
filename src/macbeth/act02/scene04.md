## SCENE IV

### Outside Macbeth's castle.

> *Enter ROSS and an old Man*

<span id="speech1">**Old Man**</span>

> <span id="2.4.1">Threescore and ten I can remember well:</span>  
> <span id="2.4.2">Within the volume of which time I have seen</span>  
> <span id="2.4.3">Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore
> night</span>  
> <span id="2.4.4">Hath trifled former knowings.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.5">Ah, good father,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.6">Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's
> act,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.7">Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis
> day,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.8">And yet dark night strangles the travelling
> lamp:</span>  
> <span id="2.4.9">Is't night's predominance, or the day's
> shame,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.10">That darkness does the face of earth
> entomb,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.11">When living light should kiss it?</span>  

<span id="speech3">**Old Man**</span>

> <span id="2.4.12">'Tis unnatural,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.13">Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday
> last,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.14">A falcon, towering in her pride of place,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.15">Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.16">And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and
> certain--</span>  
> <span id="2.4.17">Beauteous and swift, the minions of their
> race,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.18">Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung
> out,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.19">Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would
> make</span>  
> <span id="2.4.20">War with mankind.</span>  

<span id="speech5">**Old Man**</span>

> <span id="2.4.21">'Tis said they eat each other.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.22">They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes</span>  
> <span id="2.4.23">That look'd upon't. Here comes the good
> Macduff.</span>  
>
> *Enter MACDUFF*
>
> <span id="2.4.24">How goes the world, sir, now?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.4.25">Why, see you not?</span>  

<span id="speech8">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.26">Is't known who did this more than bloody
> deed?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.4.27">Those that Macbeth hath slain.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.28">Alas, the day!</span>  
> <span id="2.4.29">What good could they pretend?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.4.30">They were suborn'd:</span>  
> <span id="2.4.31">Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.32">Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon
> them</span>  
> <span id="2.4.33">Suspicion of the deed.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.34">'Gainst nature still!</span>  
> <span id="2.4.35">Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up</span>  
> <span id="2.4.36">Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like</span>  
> <span id="2.4.37">The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.4.38">He is already named, and gone to Scone</span>  
> <span id="2.4.39">To be invested.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.40">Where is Duncan's body?</span>  

<span id="speech15">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.4.41">Carried to Colmekill,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.42">The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,</span>  
> <span id="2.4.43">And guardian of their bones.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.44">Will you to Scone?</span>  

<span id="speech17">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.4.45">No, cousin, I'll to Fife.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.46">Well, I will thither.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.4.47">Well, may you see things well done there:
> adieu!</span>  
> <span id="2.4.48">Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!</span>  

<span id="speech20">**ROSS**</span>

> <span id="2.4.49">Farewell, father.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**Old Man**</span>

> <span id="2.4.50">God's benison go with you; and with those</span>  
> <span id="2.4.51">That would make good of bad, and friends of
> foes!</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
