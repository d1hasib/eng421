### The same.

> *Enter LADY MACBETH*

<span id="speech1">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.1">That which hath made them drunk hath made me
> bold;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.2">What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.3">Hark! Peace!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.4">It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal
> bellman,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.5">Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about
> it:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.6">The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms</span>  
> <span id="2.2.7">Do mock their charge with snores: I have
> drugg'd</span>  
> <span id="2.2.8">their possets,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.9">That death and nature do contend about them,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.10">Whether they live or die.</span>  

<span id="speech2">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.11">\[Within\] Who's there? what, ho!</span>  

<span id="speech3">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.12">Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.13">And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the
> deed</span>  
> <span id="2.2.14">Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers
> ready;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.15">He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled</span>  
> <span id="2.2.16">My father as he slept, I had done't.</span>  
>
> *Enter MACBETH*
>
> <span id="2.2.17">My husband!</span>  

<span id="speech4">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.18">I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a
> noise?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.19">I heard the owl scream and the crickets
> cry.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.20">Did not you speak?</span>  

<span id="speech6">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.21">When?</span>  

<span id="speech7">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.22">Now.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.23">As I descended?</span>  

<span id="speech9">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.24">Ay.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.25">Hark!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.26">Who lies i' the second chamber?</span>  

<span id="speech11">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.27">Donalbain.</span>  

<span id="speech12">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.28">This is a sorry sight.</span>  
>
> *Looking on his hands*

<span id="speech13">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.29">A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.30">There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one
> cried</span>  
> <span id="2.2.31">'Murder!'</span>  
> <span id="2.2.32">That they did wake each other: I stood and heard
> them:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.33">But they did say their prayers, and address'd
> them</span>  
> <span id="2.2.34">Again to sleep.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.35">There are two lodged together.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.36">One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the
> other;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.37">As they had seen me with these hangman's
> hands.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.38">Listening their fear, I could not say
> 'Amen,'</span>  
> <span id="2.2.39">When they did say 'God bless us!'</span>  

<span id="speech17">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.40">Consider it not so deeply.</span>  

<span id="speech18">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.41">But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.42">I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'</span>  
> <span id="2.2.43">Stuck in my throat.</span>  

<span id="speech19">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.44">These deeds must not be thought</span>  
> <span id="2.2.45">After these ways; so, it will make us mad.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.46">Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no
> more!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.47">Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent
> sleep,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.48">Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of
> care,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.49">The death of each day's life, sore labour's
> bath,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.50">Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second
> course,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.51">Chief nourisher in life's feast,--</span>  

<span id="speech21">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.52">What do you mean?</span>  

<span id="speech22">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.53">Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the
> house:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.54">'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore
> Cawdor</span>  
> <span id="2.2.55">Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no
> more.'</span>  

<span id="speech23">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.56">Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy
> thane,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.57">You do unbend your noble strength, to think</span>  
> <span id="2.2.58">So brainsickly of things. Go get some
> water,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.59">And wash this filthy witness from your
> hand.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.60">Why did you bring these daggers from the
> place?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.61">They must lie there: go carry them; and
> smear</span>  
> <span id="2.2.62">The sleepy grooms with blood.</span>  

<span id="speech24">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.63">I'll go no more:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.64">I am afraid to think what I have done;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.65">Look on't again I dare not.</span>  

<span id="speech25">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.66">Infirm of purpose!</span>  
> <span id="2.2.67">Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the
> dead</span>  
> <span id="2.2.68">Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of
> childhood</span>  
> <span id="2.2.69">That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.70">I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.71">For it must seem their guilt.</span>  
>
> *Exit. Knocking within*

<span id="speech26">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.72">Whence is that knocking?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.73">How is't with me, when every noise appals
> me?</span>  
> <span id="2.2.74">What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine
> eyes.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.75">Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this
> blood</span>  
> <span id="2.2.76">Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will
> rather</span>  
> <span id="2.2.77">The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.78">Making the green one red.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter LADY MACBETH*

<span id="speech27">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.79">My hands are of your colour; but I shame</span>  
> <span id="2.2.80">To wear a heart so white.</span>  
>
> *Knocking within*
>
> <span id="2.2.81">I hear a knocking</span>  
> <span id="2.2.82">At the south entry: retire we to our
> chamber;</span>  
> <span id="2.2.83">A little water clears us of this deed:</span>  
> <span id="2.2.84">How easy is it, then! Your constancy</span>  
> <span id="2.2.85">Hath left you unattended.</span>  
>
> *Knocking within*
>
> <span id="2.2.86">Hark! more knocking.</span>  
> <span id="2.2.87">Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call
> us,</span>  
> <span id="2.2.88">And show us to be watchers. Be not lost</span>  
> <span id="2.2.89">So poorly in your thoughts.</span>  

<span id="speech28">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.2.90">To know my deed, 'twere best not know
> myself.</span>  
>
> *Knocking within*
>
> <span id="2.2.91">Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou
> couldst!</span>  
>
> *Exeunt*
