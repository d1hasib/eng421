### The same.

> *Knocking within. Enter a Porter*

<span id="speech1">**Porter**</span>

> <span id="2.3.1">Here's a knocking indeed! If a</span>  
> <span id="2.3.2">man were porter of hell-gate, he should have</span>  
> <span id="2.3.3">old turning the key.</span>  
>
> *Knocking within*
>
> <span id="2.3.4">Knock,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.5">knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of</span>  
> <span id="2.3.6">Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged</span>  
> <span id="2.3.7">himself on the expectation of plenty: come
> in</span>  
> <span id="2.3.8">time; have napkins enow about you; here</span>  
> <span id="2.3.9">you'll sweat for't.</span>  
>
> *Knocking within*
>
> <span id="2.3.10">Knock,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.11">knock! Who's there, in the other devil's</span>  
> <span id="2.3.12">name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that
> could</span>  
> <span id="2.3.13">swear in both the scales against either
> scale;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.14">who committed treason enough for God's
> sake,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.15">yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come</span>  
> <span id="2.3.16">in, equivocator.</span>  
>
> *Knocking within*
>
> <span id="2.3.17">Knock,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.18">knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an</span>  
> <span id="2.3.19">English tailor come hither, for stealing out
> of</span>  
> <span id="2.3.20">a French hose: come in, tailor; here you
> may</span>  
> <span id="2.3.21">roast your goose.</span>  
>
> *Knocking within*
>
> <span id="2.3.22">Knock,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.23">knock; never at quiet! What are you? But</span>  
> <span id="2.3.24">this place is too cold for hell. I'll
> devil-porter</span>  
> <span id="2.3.25">it no further: I had thought to have let in</span>  
> <span id="2.3.26">some of all professions that go the
> primrose</span>  
> <span id="2.3.27">way to the everlasting bonfire.</span>  
>
> *Knocking within*
>
> <span id="2.3.28">Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the

>
> *Opens the gate*
>
> *Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX*

<span id="speech2">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.3.29">Was it so late, friend, ere you went to
> bed,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.30">That you do lie so late?</span>  

<span id="speech3">**Porter**</span>

> <span id="2.3.31">'Faith sir, we were carousing till the</span>  
> <span id="2.3.32">second cock: and drink, sir, is a great</span>  
> <span id="2.3.33">provoker of three things.</span>  

<span id="speech4">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.3.34">What three things does drink especially
> provoke?</span>  

<span id="speech5">**Porter**</span>

> <span id="2.3.35">Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and</span>  
> <span id="2.3.36">urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and
> unprovokes;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.37">it provokes the desire, but it takes</span>  
> <span id="2.3.38">away the performance: therefore, much drink</span>  
> <span id="2.3.39">may be said to be an equivocator with
> lechery:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.40">it makes him, and it mars him; it sets</span>  
> <span id="2.3.41">him on, and it takes him off; it persuades
> him,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.42">and disheartens him; makes him stand to,
> and</span>  
> <span id="2.3.43">not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates
> him</span>  
> <span id="2.3.44">in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves
> him.</span>  

<span id="speech6">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.3.45">I believe drink gave thee the lie last
> night.</span>  

<span id="speech7">**Porter**</span>

> <span id="2.3.46">That it did, sir, i' the very throat on</span>  
> <span id="2.3.47">me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I</span>  
> <span id="2.3.48">think, being too strong for him, though he
> took</span>  
> <span id="2.3.49">up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to
> cast</span>  
> <span id="2.3.50">him.</span>  

<span id="speech8">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.3.51">Is thy master stirring?</span>  
>
> *Enter MACBETH*
>
> <span id="2.3.52">Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.</span>  

<span id="speech9">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="2.3.53">Good morrow, noble sir.</span>  

<span id="speech10">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.3.54">Good morrow, both.</span>  

<span id="speech11">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.3.55">Is the king stirring, worthy thane?</span>  

<span id="speech12">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.3.56">Not yet.</span>  

<span id="speech13">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.3.57">He did command me to call timely on him:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.58">I have almost slipp'd the hour.</span>  

<span id="speech14">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.3.59">I'll bring you to him.</span>  

<span id="speech15">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.3.60">I know this is a joyful trouble to you;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.61">But yet 'tis one.</span>  

<span id="speech16">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.3.62">The labour we delight in physics pain.</span>  
> <span id="2.3.63">This is the door.</span>  

<span id="speech17">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.3.64">I'll make so bold to call,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.65">For 'tis my limited service.</span>  
>
> *Exit*

<span id="speech18">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="2.3.66">Goes the king hence to-day?</span>  

<span id="speech19">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.3.67">He does: he did appoint so.</span>  

<span id="speech20">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="2.3.68">The night has been unruly: where we lay,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.69">Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they
> say,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.70">Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of
> death,</span>  
> <span id="2.3.71">And prophesying with accents terrible</span>  
> <span id="2.3.72">Of dire combustion and confused events</span>  
> <span id="2.3.73">New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure
> bird</span>  
> <span id="2.3.74">Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the
> earth</span>  
> <span id="2.3.75">Was feverous and did shake.</span>  

<span id="speech21">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.3.76">'Twas a rough night.</span>  

<span id="speech22">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="2.3.77">My young remembrance cannot parallel</span>  
> <span id="2.3.78">A fellow to it.</span>  
>
> *Re-enter MACDUFF*

<span id="speech23">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.3.79">O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart</span>  
> <span id="2.3.80">Cannot conceive nor name thee!</span>  

<span id="speech24">**MACBETH**</span> <span
id="speech25">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="2.3.81">What's the matter.</span>  

<span id="speech26">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.3.82">Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!</span>  
> <span id="2.3.83">Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope</span>  
> <span id="2.3.84">The Lord's anointed temple, and stole
> thence</span>  
> <span id="2.3.85">The life o' the building!</span>  

<span id="speech27">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.3.86">What is 't you say? the life?</span>  

<span id="speech28">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="2.3.87">Mean you his majesty?</span>  

<span id="speech29">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.3.88">Approach the chamber, and destroy your
> sight</span>  
> <span id="2.3.89">With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;</span>  
> <span id="2.3.90">See, and then speak yourselves.</span>  
>
> *Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX*

> <span id="2.3.91">Awake, awake!</span>

> <span id="2.3.96">The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!</span>

> *Enter LADY MACBETH*

<span id="speech30">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.3.99">What's the business,</span>

> <span id="2.3.101">The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!</span>  

<span id="speech31">**MACDUFF**</span>

> <span id="2.3.102">O gentle lady,</span>

<span id="speech32">**LADY MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.3.109">What, in our house?</span>  

<span id="speech33">**BANQUO**</span>

> <span id="2.3.110">Too cruel any where.</span>  
> <span id="2.3.111">Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,</span>

> *Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS*

<span id="speech34">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.3.113">Had I but died an hour before this chance,</span>

<span id="speech35">**DONALBAIN**</span>

> <span id="2.3.119">What is amiss?</span>  

<span id="speech36">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.3.120">You are, and do not know't:</span>  
> <span id="2.3.121">The spring, the head, the fountain of your

<span id="speech37">**MACDUFF**</span>

<span id="speech38">**MALCOLM**</span>

<span id="speech39">**LENNOX**</span>

> <span id="2.3.125">Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done

> <span id="2.3.127">So were their daggers, which unwiped we

<span id="speech40">**MACBETH**</span>

> <span id="2.3.131">O, yet I do repent me of my fury,</span>
